cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/senate-border-foreign-aid-bill/index.html,"CNN — Senators unveiled a long-awaited border deal and foreign aid package with assistance for Ukraine and Israel on Sunday, paving the way for a key vote in the chamber this week in which the legislation is at risk of failing and, if it does pass, setting up a clash with the House. In a sign of the grim odds facing the legislation, Speaker Mike Johnson declared the deal “dead on arrival” in the House after the text was released Sunday evening. The deal gives the president far-reaching powers to significantly restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. If passed, the agreement would mark a tough change to immigration law, which hasn’t been modified for decades. The sweeping $118.2 billion legislative package would also provide aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine. The border deal has placed one of the most vexing political issues at the center of President Joe Biden’s foreign policy agenda and forced him to take a tougher stance on an issue that has been a liability ahead of November. The compromise would implement strict limits along the US southern border that have not been previously enshrined into law and would, in effect, severely curtail asylum at the US-Mexico border, a break with decades-long protocol.

John Moore/Getty Images Related article Key highlights of the Senate’s proposed border deal package It’s the product of months of bipartisan negotiations with a trio of senators – Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the chamber’s most conservative Republicans. But former President Donald Trump and Johnson have attacked the border deal as too weak, and their opposition threatens to derail the legislation. “If this bill reaches the House, it will be dead on arrival,” Johnson wrote on X. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise slammed the border deal on Sunday evening and said it will not get a vote in the chamber, a move that will ramp up pressure even further on Senate Republicans and could convince on-the-fence Republicans to vote against it knowing the measure won’t even be considered on the House floor. “Let me be clear: The Senate Border Bill will NOT receive a vote in the House,” the Louisiana Republican wrote on X. According to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the bill includes roughly $60 billion to support Ukraine in its war against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel, and $20.23 billion for operational needs and capabilities at the border and to provide resources for the new border policies – an amount that rises above the $14 billion Biden initially requested for border security. The package also includes billions of dollars for regional partners in the Indo-Pacific. Biden said in a statement Sunday that he “strongly supports” the Senate border bill, calling it “the toughest and fairest set of border reforms in decades.” If Congress is unable to pass the legislative package, senators will have to decide whether to try to pass aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan separately from border and immigration measures. Johnson announced Saturday that the House will vote this week on a standalone bill providing aid for Israel. The Louisiana Republican called on the Senate to take up that bill swiftly, ratcheting up pressure on senators to abandon their efforts to keep Israel aid linked with other issues. It’s unclear whether a foreign aid package would be able to pass on its own as many Senate Republicans have demanded tighter border security in exchange for aid to those allies. Senate on track for key vote this week The Senate is expected to hold a key test vote on the package no later than Wednesday, but that initial vote – on whether to begin debate – would require 60 votes to pass, and it’s unclear whether there will be sufficient support to clear the hurdle. Republican senators risk defying Trump if they vote in favor and may be even more reluctant to do so now that Johnson has signaled the package would be dead on arrival in the House. Not long after the deal was released, some Republican senators, including Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, indicated they would not support it. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah also slammed the agreement in a series of posts on X, saying “no self-respecting Senator should agree to vote on this 370-page bill this week.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that “the Senate must carefully consider the opportunity in front of us and prepare to act,” and thanked Lankford “for working tirelessly to ensure that supplemental national security legislation begins with direct and immediate solutions to the crisis at our southern border.” The US Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 31, 2024. Julia Nikhinson/AFP/Getty Images Related article READ: Text of senators’ proposed border deal and foreign aid package Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on a press call that he is “confident the majority of senators want to get this done,” adding, “to do so we need to shut out the noise.” The New York Democrat called the agreement “a monumental step towards strengthening America’s national security abroad and along our borders,” and said, “frankly, I have never worked more closely with Leader McConnell on any piece of legislation as we did on this. We both realized the gravity of the situation and how important passage is both for the United States and the world.” Senate GOP Whip John Thune was noncommittal last week when asked whether there will be enough support from Senate Republicans to overcome Trump’s opposition. “I don’t know the answer to that yet,” Thune, the GOP’s chief vote counter, told CNN’s Manu Raju. Thune argued that “there’s a lot of really good conservative border policy” in the deal, but he also noted, “It’s become a target … and in the end you want to make law.” In recent weeks, Trump has been lobbying Republicans both in private and public to oppose the deal, according to GOP sources familiar with the conversations – in part because he wants to campaign on the issue and doesn’t want Biden to score a victory in an area where he is politically vulnerable. In contrast, Biden has endorsed the border deal, saying in a statement at the end of last month that it would give him as president “a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed,” and vowing to use that authority immediately if the bill becomes law. Biden’s embrace of tougher border measures comes as he attempts to fend off Trump’s attacks over immigration policy ahead of the election, but risks putting the president at odds with progressive allies. In a move highlighting the tensions around the issue, GOP governors from around the country joined Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in Eagle Pass on Sunday in a show of support for Texas’ program for securing the border. “We are here to send a loud and clear message that we are banding together to fight to ensure that we will be able to maintain our constitutional guarantee that state’s will be able to defend against any type of imminent danger or invasion,” Abbott said. What’s in the border deal The deal will grant the Department of Homeland Security new emergency authority to clamp down on border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. Once the authority is triggered, the DHS secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increased above 5,000 on average per day on a given week, DHS would be required to use the authority. The authority sunsets after three years. Migrants could still seek asylum at a port of entry. The bill would codify a process that requires the government to process 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry, while also raising the standard for asylum and expediting the process. Those who didn’t qualify for asylum will be swiftly deported. Taken together, the Senate deal aims to speed up the asylum process to consider cases within six months — compared with the current system, under which it can take up to 10 years for asylum seekers. It would also make it more difficult for migrants to prove they’re eligible for asylum. It’s unlikely that the deal could take immediate effect even if it were to pass, as it would require immense resources, including the hiring of additional personnel, which often takes months. As the deal has come under attack on the far right, Senate negotiators have attempted to dispel what they say are misrepresentations of the agreement. Conservatives have argued the Senate’s package would allow thousands of migrants to enter the US every day – a line of attack negotiators have pushed back. “We believe that by quickly implementing this system, individuals who come for economic reasons will learn very quickly that this is not a path to enter our country and will not take the sometimes dangerous or treacherous trek to our border,” Sinema, who has lived her life close to the Mexican border, said on CBS on Sunday. Lankford has also rejected claims that the deal would give blanket permission for migrants to enter the United States and said the bill is not a “betrayal” as Trump has told supporters. Trump, meanwhile, has argued that Republicans should not accept any kind of compromise and that a bill is not necessary, while Johnson has railed against the deal. At a recent news conference, Johnson denied pushing to kill the Senate border deal to help Trump on the campaign trail, but the speaker said he has spoken to Trump “at length.” “I have talked to former President Trump about this issue at length and he understands that we have a responsibility to do here,” Johnson told CNN.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/strikes-us-uk-houthi-yemen/index.html,"CNN — The US and UK have conducted strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen from air and surface platforms, including fighter jets, with the support of several other countries. At least 30 targets were struck across at least 10 locations, according to two US officials. The targets included command and control; an underground weapons storage facility; and other weapons used by the Houthis to target international shipping lanes, one official said. “Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to continue to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,” the US and UK said in a joint statement with Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Two US destroyers fired Tomahawk missiles as part of the strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, a US official told CNN. The USS Gravely and USS Carney, both of which are Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, fired the land-attack cruise missiles during the operation. F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier also took part in the strikes, officials said. Earlier Saturday, the US struck six Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles before they were launched toward the Red Sea, US Central Command said. The strikes on consecutive days come as the Biden administration has adopted a “multi-tiered” response to a drone attack that killed three US service members and wounded scores more last weekend. US-led coalition conducts airstrikes in Yemen in response to the Houthi aggression at the Red Sea on February 3, 2024. US Central Command Seeking to avoid a regional war with Tehran, the US has not targeted Iran directly, instead going after some of its most powerful proxies in the region. It is an indirect way of trying to send a message to Iran’s leadership, which has grown increasingly nervous about the actions of some of the militant organizations it backs, CNN has reported. Iran funds, arms and supplies these groups to different degrees, but its leadership does not control them directly. The strikes in Yemen are distinct from the attacks in Iraq and Syria: The former is a response to ongoing Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes and US warships in the Red Sea, while the latter is a retaliation for a deadly attack on US troops. But both target Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the most recent strikes “are intended to further disrupt and degrade the capabilities” of the Houthi militia. “This collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels,” Austin said in a statement Saturday. “We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways.” President Joe Biden gave the green light for Saturday’s strikes earlier in the week, according to two senior administration officials who stressed to CNN that the US doesn’t want escalation and the strikes are in direct response to the actions by the Houthis. Biden conceded last month that previous strikes against the Houthis did not deter the rebel group but made clear that the strikes will continue. Meanwhile, Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said in a statement Saturday, “The US-British coalition’s bombing of a number of Yemeni provinces will not change our position, and we affirm that our military operations against Israel will continue until the crimes of genocide in Gaza are stopped and the siege on its residents is lifted, no matter the sacrifices it costs us.” On Friday, the US carried out separate, unilateral strikes against four sites in Syria and three in Iraq, hitting more than 85 targets, including command and control centers, intelligence centers and weapons facilities. “We believe that the strikes were successful,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said following the operation. But the Biden administration vowed there would be further actions taken against Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria. Austin said in a statement that the US strikes on Friday were “the start of our response.” Neither the White House nor the Pentagon would telegraph exactly when the next stages of the response would play out. US-led coalition conducts airstrikes in Yemen in response to the Houthi aggression at the Red Sea on February 3, 2024. US Central Command Almost exactly 24 hours after the first US weapons hit their targets in Iraq and Syria, the US carried out more strikes in Yemen. Saturday’s strikes are the third time in recent weeks the US and UK attacked Houthi targets as part of a joint operation. On January 11, the two militaries struck approximately 30 Houthi sites. Less than two weeks later, the US and UK struck another eight sites. The previous strikes targeted Houthi weapons storage facilities and radar sites in an attempt to disrupt the ability of the Iran-backed rebel group to attack international shipping lanes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, some of the world’s most critical waterways. But the Houthis have remained defiant, vowing after the last round of US-led strikes they are “more determined to confront” what they called the US and UK “aggressors.” In addition to the larger scale strikes on Houthi targets, the US has carried out smaller attacks on Houthi weaponry. On Friday, US forces struck four Houthi drones that US Central Command says were prepared to launch and posed an “imminent threat” to shipping lanes and US warships. The same day, US forces, including a guided missile destroyer and an F/A-18 fighter jet, shot down a total of eight drones over the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/ronna-mcdaniel-rnc-trump/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump suggested in an interview aired Sunday that he thought there would likely be changes at the Republican National Committee, which is led by Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. “I think she did great when she ran Michigan for me. I think she did OK initially in the RNC. I would say right now there’ll probably be some changes made,” Trump told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.” His comments came in response to a question about how he thought McDaniel was performing. Last week, the Republican National Committee reported its lowest cash on hand figure since 2014, according to FEC filings . The RNC had just $8 million in the bank at the end of December, the lowest figure since it reported about $5 million in cash on hand in 2014 . The committee was outraised by the Democratic National Committee, which raised about $40 million to its GOP counterpart’s $20 million during the fourth quarter of last year. And the DNC held a large cash advantage over the RNC, reporting about $21 million banked. McDaniel has also faced criticism from some Republicans after the GOP underperformed in the 2022 midterms and lost on several high-profile ballot questions in 2023. Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy sharply criticized McDaniel at a GOP presidential debate and said the GOP was “a party of losers” after Republicans “got trounced” in high-profile elections in November in Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky. Ramaswamy blamed McDaniel for Republican underperformance dating to 2018. The 2024 Republican National Committee winter meeting in Las Vegas, which wrapped this weekend, highlighted divisions within the group over whether to blame 2022’s disappointing results on McDaniel or on Trump. Some RNC members at the event were frustrated by criticisms of McDaniel, arguing that Trump’s legal issues could hurt rest of the GOP ticket in 2024. Others, meanwhile, took aim at McDaniel’s handling of the organization’s budget and finances. As chair of the Michigan GOP during the 2016 presidential election, McDaniel worked to deliver the key state for Trump — the first time a Republican presidential candidate had won Michigan in almost 30 years. McDaniel had the former president’s backing when she first ran for party chair in 2017; last year, she was elected to a fourth consecutive term . Trump did not back a candidate in that race, stating that McDaniel and Harmeet Dhillon , an RNC committeewoman from California and attorney who has represented Trump , should “fight it out.” McDaniel, meanwhile, has remained loyal to the former president during the 2024 presidential campaign, calling for his GOP rival Nikki Haley to drop out after her defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire. “We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump,” McDaniel told Fox News last month.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/us-damage-assessment-syria-iraq/index.html,"CNN — The US destroyed or damaged 84 out of 85 targets in its sweeping series of airstrikes on Friday in Syria and Iraq, according to two US defense officials, with no indications of Iranian casualties. All but one of the 85 targets were “destroyed or functionally damaged,” the officials said, citing a preliminary battlefield damage assessment. A complete post-strike analysis is still underway, but one official said there are no indications that members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed as part of the operations. President Joe Biden told reporters traveling with him to Nevada Sunday that the strikes are working to deter and disrupt militant groups’ operations in the region. In response to a drone attack that killed three US service members and wounded scores more in Jordan last weekend, the US targeted facilities and weapons used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. Video Ad Feedback Expert: This is why using B-1 bombers in strike is a big deal 01:19 - Source: CNN It marked the first time the US has carried out strikes in both countries simultaneously. In Iraq, the US targeted al-Qaim and Akashat near the border with Syria. And in Syria, the US struck near al-Barum, Deir ez-Zur and al-Mayadin.  The target list included command and control centers, intelligence centers, rockets, missile, drone storage facilities and more. On Friday, in a briefing with reporters after the strikes, Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, said the targets were chosen “with an idea that there would likely be casualties associated with people inside those facilities.” The Biden administration has faced criticism that it waited too long to respond to the deadly drone strike in Jordan, which gave the Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria time to move their personnel. Sims said on Friday that good weather conditions for the operation weren’t present until Friday night. Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes, far larger than previous US operations in Iraq or Syria, were only the start of the US response. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “ State of the Union ” earlier Sunday that the US retaliation for the strike that killed three US service members was not over. Sullivan called the Friday strikes the “beginning of our response and there will be more steps to come.” Since the US strikes, there has been one attack on Saturday against US forces at Mission Support Site Euphrates, also known as the Conoco oil fields, according to one of the defense officials. The attack consisted of two rockets launched against the site, with no injuries or damage reported."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/nikki-haley-texas-secede-us/index.html,"CNN — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Sunday walked back her previous comment that Texas could secede from the US if it decided to do so. “No. According to the Constitution, they can’t,” Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” when asked whether she thought the Lone Star State had a right to secede. “What I do think they have the right to do is have the power to protect themselves and do all that. Texas has talked about seceding for a long time. The Constitution doesn’t allow for that,” she said. “But what I will say is  …  Where’s that coming from? That’s coming from the fact that people don’t think that government is listening to them.” Her comments mark a turnaround from remarks she made last week, when Haley told radio host Charlemagne tha God that “if Texas decides they want to do that, they can do that.” “If that whole state says ‘We don’t want to be part of America anymore,’ I mean that’s their decision to make,” Haley said on “The Breakfast Club.” Haley’s comments last week echoed the stance she articulated in a 2013 interview in which she said she believed that, under the Constitution, states have the right to secede from the rest of the country. The Supreme Court ruled in 1869 that states do not have a constitutional right to unilaterally secede. Haley drew considerable backlash in December when she didn’t mention slavery as a cause of the Civil War during a town hall in New Hampshire. She later sought to clarify her comments, stating: “I mean, of course the Civil War was about slavery.” The former South Carolina governor is facing intense pressure to drop out of the 2024 GOP primary after losing the first two contests of the Republican primary cycle to former President Donald Trump. Still, her campaign brought in $16.5 million in new donations in January, making it Haley’s best month of fundraising to date, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Haley has said that while she doesn’t need to beat Trump in her home state’s Republican presidential primary later this month, the results need to be better for her than they were in New Hampshire.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/china-trump-tariffs-taiwan/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump said Sunday he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he regains the presidency. His remarks come at a time of high economic and other tensions between the US and China . “No, I would say maybe it’s going to be more than that,” Trump said when asked by Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” whether he would consider imposing a 60% tariff, as The Washington Post has reported. As president, Trump slapped tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods in June 2018. Beijing countered with its own tariffs, and the spiral continued until the two countries arrived at an agreement in 2020. The Biden administration has largely kept the Trump-era tariffs in place. The former president also said he thought China would try to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. “I think they will, and they won’t be interfering on my behalf. We should go same-day voting, paper ballots, voter ID and no mail-in ballots,” Trump said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN has reported. But FBI Director Christopher Wray warned Wednesday that Chinese hackers are preparing to “wreak havoc and cause real-world harm” to the US. Trump also praised Xi, whom he described as “a very good friend of mine during my term,” and said, “I want China to do great, I do.” Trump would not say whether he would intervene if China tried taking over Taiwan, arguing that doing so would “jeopardize my negotiating ability with China.” China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and leader Xi has not ruled out the use of military force to “reunify” the island with the mainland. The US, meanwhile, is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself, something Beijing regards as interference in its internal affairs.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/us-retaliatory-military-strikes-iran-cnntv/index.html,"CNN — The US will take “further action” after conducting major airstrikes over the weekend against Iranian-backed militias who have carried out attacks on US troops in the Middle East, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. “I would just say that the president was clear when he ordered them and when he conducted them that that was the beginning of our response and there will be more steps to come,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Sullivan, in response to Bash asking whether that meant the US was planning additional strikes, said, “What it means is that we will take further action. “I’m not going to, obviously, describe the character of that action because I don’t want to telegraph our punches,” he said. Sullivan’s comments comes after the US has adopted a “multi-tiered” response to the drone attack that killed three US service members and wounded more than 40 others last week. The attack brought the worst loss of US military life in the region in nearly three years and the first US military fatalities since the war in Gaza erupted. On Friday, the US hit 85 targets across seven locations in Iraq and Syria, a significant escalation in tensions between the US and Iran-backed groups attacking American bases across the region in protest of Israel’s war in Gaza. Believed to be funded and trained by Iran, these groups view the US as responsible for Israel’s actions by supplying weapons to the Jewish state and failing to force a ceasefire. The US strikes killed at least 16 people in Iraq, including civilians, and injured 25 others, the Iraqi government said Friday. The attacks hit areas close to the border with Syria and targeted facilities used by Iranian-linked al Hashd al Shabi — or Popular Mobilization Units — in the Iraqi city of Al-Qaim, Iraqi officials said. The US is “still assessing the battle damage” from Friday night’s strikes in Iraq and Syria, Sullivan said, and “our CENTCOM, Central Command, is looking at the capabilities we reduced and the casualties that were incurred.” CNN cannot independently verify the number or nature of the casualties. The next day, the US and UK conducted strikes on at least 30 Houthi targets in Yemen from air and surface platforms, including fighter jets, with the support of several other countries. Saturday’s strikes specifically targeted Houthi weapons storage facilities and equipment. The Houthis responded by saying they will not stop until Israel ends its operations in Gaza. As to whether the US is now embroiled in a regional conflict, Sullivan maintained that the Iran-backed militia attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria are separate from the Houthi strikes on Red Sea shipping, calling them “distinct but related challenges.” But he said that Tehran is at the center of most of it. “Iran has a significant and pernicious responsibility for much of the instability in the Middle East,” he said. “And that has to be factored into how we approach everything that we’re doing and how Israel has to approach everything it’s doing.” The Biden administration is threading a needle – it wants to deter and stop further attacks but avoid a full-scale conflict with Iran in a region already roiled by the continuing Israel-Hamas war. “We are not looking to take the United States to war,” Sullivan said. “So we are going to continue to pursue a policy that goes down both of those lines simultaneously, that responds with force and clarity, as we did on Friday night, but also that continues to hew to an approach that does not get the United States pulled into a war that we have seen too frequently in the Middle East.” Asked whether the US would rule out strikes inside Iran, Sullivan said he is “not going to rule in and rule out any activity anywhere,” but that “the president will do what he thinks needs to be done.” A senior administration official previously confirmed to CNN that the US will not attack on Iranian soil and will focus only on targets outside of the country. Tehran has repeatedly said it does not seek conflict. On Friday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said his country will not initiate a war but will “respond strongly.” CNN’s Jack Forrest, Haley Britzky , Kevin Liptak , Oren Liebermann and Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/biden-trump-2024-election-great-lakes/index.html,"CNN — Just how does Joe Biden win reelection? National polls show him trailing Donald Trump more often than leading him – a rare position for an incumbent to be in at this point in the campaign. These national polls, though, mean little. You win elections state by state through the Electoral College. Back in 2020 , the closest battleground states (i.e., those decided by 3 points or less) were either around the Great Lakes (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) or along the Sun Belt (Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina). Biden would be reelected if he wins all the states in either region, so long as he also carries the remaining states he took in 2020. At this point, though, it seems his easiest path to a second term runs through the Great Lakes rather than the Sun Belt. Look at two Fox News polls released Thursday. Biden and Trump were tied in Wisconsin – a state the president won by less than a point in 2020. In Georgia, another state Biden won by less than a point four years ago, Trump held an 8-point edge. These Fox News polls are not outliers. Trump hasn’t led (even within the margin of error) in any Wisconsin poll this cycle that meets CNN’s standards for publication. On the other end, he hasn’t trailed in any Georgia poll in well over a year. Former President Donald Trump meets with members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at their headquarters in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, January 31. Andrew Harnik/AP Related article The union vote is becoming more Republican These two states fit within a larger pattern we’ve seen in the polling data. Trump has generally had a clear advantage in Arizona , while Biden and Trump have traded leads in Pennsylvania. Recent Pennsylvania polls from Franklin & Marshall College and Quinnipiac University gave Biden a slightly higher vote share than Trump, but his advantage was within the margin of error. Likewise, the polling in Nevada has generally been strong for Trump. The limited North Carolina polling hasn’t been great for Biden either. Biden’s weakest state in the Great Lakes battleground surveys has been Michigan , though he has polled better there than any Sun Belt swing state. He’s also done better in Michigan polls of likely voters than of registered voters. This includes the New York Times/Siena College survey last fall that found him down 5 points to Trump among registered voters, though tied among likely voters. (That large gap between registered voters and likely voters fits with what we’ve seen nationally and may be greater in Michigan because the state has universal voter registration . In other words, Biden is doing worse among those less likely to vote.) Biden and United Auto Workers chief Shawn Fain, left, meet with autoworkers in Warren, Michigan, on February 1, 2024. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters National trends The fact that Biden is doing better in the Great Lakes than the Sun Belt makes a lot of sense when you look at national polls. Folks like me have been pointing out for a long time that Biden is seeing historically weak support for a Democrat among Hispanic and Black voters nationally . Hispanic voters make up a disproportionate share of the electorate in Arizona and Nevada compared with on the national level. Black voters make up a disproportionate share of the electorate in Georgia and North Carolina compared with nationwide. The racial group Biden has tended to hold his own with is White voters. Recent polls from CNN/SSRS , The New York Times and Quinnipiac have Biden doing about as well with this demographic as he did in 2020 . White voters made up at least 80% of 2020 voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to both the network exit polls and data from the US Census Bureau. They were somewhere between 67% and 71% nationally in the two data sets. President Joe Biden speaks to members of the United Auto Workers in Warren, Michigan, on February 1, 2024.

Again, this fits with the state being the Great Lakes battleground where Biden is doing the worst in 2024. Expect Biden to make a lot more visits to the Wolverine State, like he did earlier this week. Now, none of this is to say that Biden should solely be relying on winning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Beyond the fact that his Michigan polling hasn’t been good – he’s trailed in a number of polls – Biden would be winning the bare minimum in the Electoral College if he carried those three states plus every state he won by at least 5 points in 2020. Getting exactly 270 electoral votes doesn’t leave Biden with any room for error, especially if he ends up doing worse among White voters than current polling indicates. (This is what happened in 2020.) video Related video Hear why Biden 2020 voter isn’t backing the president this time On the other hand, if Biden starts to improve with Hispanic and/or Black voters, his polling in the Sun Belt could improve. With so much time between now and November, Biden’s got to be giving himself multiple options. Still, if someone was taking bets at this point, Biden’s easiest path to 270 electoral votes seems to be through the North, not the South."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/haley-trump-age-morals-wealth-2024-analysis/index.html,"CNN — Nikki Haley now says Donald Trump is too old, too confused, too chaotic, and too tantrum-prone to be president — and in a jab likely to especially infuriate her rival, warns he even lacks the money to mount a proper White House run. The former South Carolina governor — the former president’s last opponent standing in the GOP nominating race — is turning up the heat as she battles to prevent a career-besmirching shellacking in her home state primary. Haley laid out a stinging character study of the former president in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday. Grouping Trump with President Joe Biden , she said it was “absurd” that the country would be stuck with two 80-year-old candidates. (Biden is 81 and Trump is 77.) She warned that Trump has had some “confused moments” in recent days, and she rebuked the ex-president for a “temper tantrum” on the night of his New Hampshire primary win when he tried to push her out of the race. In recent campaign events, Haley has also questioned Trump’s morality and capacity to tell right from wrong. Former President Donald Trump speaks in Nashua, New Hampshire, on January 23, 2024, after he was projected to win the state's Republican primary. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images Related article Trump ramps up efforts to attract more megadonors as Haley launches fundraising blitz Her harsh turn against the boss she once served as US ambassador to the United Nations begs the question of why, after months of dancing around Trump’s character issues, legal quagmire and assault on democracy, she’s finally getting tough. Has Haley found her voice, located a sweet spot where she can target the former president or decided to commit to a new hardline strategy that she thinks might bring down the overwhelming favorite for his third straight nomination? Or is Haley simply joining the long and inglorious tradition of Republican candidates who lash out at Trump only when they’ve already been effectively crushed by him, including the unhappy Florida trio of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio in 2016 and current Gov. Ron DeSantis at the end of his misfiring 2024 race? DeSantis struggled with how to deal with Trump for his entire campaign and he only let loose with searing attacks against his former mentor when his cause already seemed hopeless ahead of his second place finish in Iowa last month. DeSantis criticized Trump for not showing up to debates and claimed that the conservative media acted as a “Praetorian guard” to protect him. “You can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he’ll say you are wonderful,” DeSantis said. Ironically, the comments by DeSantis directly predicted how the ex-president behaved toward him when DeSantis pulled out and promptly endorsed a man who had subjected him to the cruelest of character attacks for months. Haley is insisting that her campaign is, unlike that of DeSantis, built for a prolonged delegate fight against Trump and is pledging to stay in the race long after her home state’s Republican primary on February 24. “Why is the political elite pushing us to name a nominee when only two states have voted? There are 48 states and more territories that haven’t voted. In the delegate count you need 1,215 delegates. Donald Trump has 32. I have 17. Why would we stop now?” Haley asked a crowd in Hilton Head on Thursday. Haley goes after Trump — up to a point Haley, while noticeably sharpening her tone, has not adopted the full-on, point of no return attacks on Trump over his perceived unfitness for office or his assault on democracy like those fired off by her former Republican primary rival Chris Christie or from ex-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. Such rhetoric offers a fast one-way ticket out of Republican politics and there’s no sign yet Haley wants to risk any future presidential prospects, assuming that she doesn’t pull off a massive upset this year. But taking on Trump directly is risky. Few Republicans emerge unscathed from a direct confrontation with the former president given his extraordinary hold over the party’s base voters and acidic tongue. The plain truth is that Trump is willing and able to hit far lower than any candidate who attacks him. But can Haley, in a losing cause, draw a line that will allow her to tell voters in a future presidential race that she predicted an eventual Trump loss to Biden or his chaotic and lawless second term? Or will her new willingness to face down the ex-president so enrage him and alienate his supporters that she hurts her future viability? In this screengrab from video, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley speaks with CNN's Jake Tapper during an interview on Thursday, February 1, 2024. CNN Related article Haley calls out Trump and his PACs for spending $50 million on legal fees Haley took her critique of Trump to a new level Thursday in the interview with Tapper, driving home an attack that she’s been honing in South Carolina in recent days. She pounced on new filings that showed that two of the ex-president’s political action committees had spent nearly $29 million on his legal fees during the last six months of 2023 as he faces multiple criminal and civil trials. The New York Times, meanwhile, first reported that the Trump PACs’ legal spending was expected to total roughly $50 million for the year. “Get ready to spend more campaign dollars on legal fees, because those court cases have just started. He’s got two in March and they go out for the rest of the year,” Haley said on “The Lead.” She added: “It is unconscionable to me that a candidate would spend $50 million in legal fees. It explains why he’s not doing many rallies. He doesn’t have the money to do it.” Earlier, in an event in Columbia, South Carolina, Haley asked an audience:  “Do you really think he is going to win against Joe Biden when he is spending that much on legal fees? He is not.” Haley’s mention of money may anger Trump more than just about any other insult since he’s used his great wealth as a tool to build his mythology as a great businessman and it appears central to his self-image. But the former president may well have money problems coming down the track that at least will test his store of ready cash and could force him to sell or mortgage some real estate assets. In addition to his steep legal fees, a New York jury last week said Trump should pay $83.3 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation after he was found liable in an earlier civil trial of sexually assaulting her. The former president is also braced for the outcome of a New York civil fraud trial against him, his organization and his adult sons that could see him ordered to pay several hundreds of millions of dollars in disgorgement – or over ill-gotten gains. Trump may also be barred from doing business in the state of New York, a move that could prove hugely damaging to his real estate empire. Given the financial clouds swirling around Trump — not to mention the four pending criminal trials he faces — Haley’s comments about money are likely to cut deep. Yet the former UN ambassador also showed in her comments that she’s still holding back and is not willing to unleash the kind of direct attack on Trump that would inevitably damage her future prospects in a party transformed in his image. She said in Columbia that she hadn’t “paid attention to his court cases. I don’t know where he’s innocent where he’s guilty or what’s happened.” Given that Haley is running against Trump and his legal exposure is his greatest liability in a general election, it might be incumbent on Haley to consider the mountain of charges and evidence against her rival. Considering that women voters are likely to play a critical role in the general election, another candidate might have brought up Trump’s alleged behavior toward Carroll. Especially one trying to break the highest glass ceiling to become the first woman president. The closest that Haley has come to discussing the details of the case was when she said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, “I absolutely trust the jury.” Similarly, Haley has been unwilling to go delve deeply into Trump’s false claims of 2020 election fraud and the ransacking of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. For months on the campaign trail she alluded to Trump’s past behavior obliquely, arguing that it was time for a new generation of leadership to move the country on. And she finally arrived at this dodge: “I was proud to serve in his administration. I agree with a lot of his policies, but rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him.” Haley added at a rally in New Hampshire last month, “You know I’m right. Chaos follows him,” drawing applause from her supporters. Republicans don’t like it when rivals speak ill of Trump But Haley’s tentative way of referring to the pandemonium of the Trump presidency almost suggests that the former commander in chief had no agency in creating the mayhem of the worst attack on American democracy in modern times. But she had little choice. This was a message designed to navigate Haley past a critical reality of the GOP nominating race — there is no advantage to be won among core GOP primary voters from hammering Trump or truth-telling about his record. The findings of a new CNN/SSRS poll released on Thursday encapsulated Haley’s dilemma. While it showed her beating Biden in a hypothetical general election matchup by 13 points among registered voters, the poll found that 70% of Republicans had a preference for Trump and only 19% preferred her as their nominee. Haley’s performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, where she did well among moderate, suburban Republicans and independents but struggled with hard-core Republicans tell the story of the former president’s dominance in the nomination race. These figures explain why Haley — and GOP rivals like DeSantis were in such a vise over the last year. They had to find a way to exploit Trump’s greatest general election liabilities in the knowledge that most Republican voters had no interest in hearing about them. Trump’s campaign is increasing its counter-attacks on Haley, hoping that a crushing victory in South Carolina will end her White House bid. On Thursday, a group of state lawmakers who have endorsed the ex-president held two news conferences designed to destroy her reputation among GOP voters in her home state. South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace accused Haley of being pro-China. “We need a man who’s going to be strong and whose enemies will fear him. Nikki Haley is China’s favorite governor,” Mace, herself a former critic of Trump, said. South Carolina state Rep. Bill Taylor hit back at some of Haley’s recent criticisms that Trump only thinks of himself. “Nikki Haley is not the right candidate to be president of the United States. Nikki is always about Nikki,” Taylor said. While it’s theoretically possible that Haley’s new truth telling — up to a point — about Trump as well as the former president’s very public legal crises could begin to turn sentiment against him in the primary, there’s more reason to suspect that it will not. And Haley seems destined to join the ranks of Republican candidates who were willing to call out Trump’s character and conduct — only when it was too late."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/politics/wray-china-hacking-analysis/index.html,"CNN — FBI Director Christopher Wray opened up with Americans about a grave double threat on Wednesday, giving a textbook example of using his power and position to get attention. His stunning warning about China’s capacity to “wreak havoc” on US infrastructure and directly harm Americans shed new light on the ambition of America’s new superpower foe and helps give context to the fragile relations between Washington and Beijing that are already showing up as an issue in the 2024 campaign. CNN Related article FBI director warns that Chinese hackers are preparing to ‘wreak havoc’ on US critical infrastructure And, experts said, Wray’s bombshell assessment about the vulnerabilities of the systems that underpin daily life reflected a growing issue – the interconnected nature of new transport, power and energy networks that could mean a future cyberattack on a single node could paralyze the entire country. Rick Geddes, director of Cornell University’s Infrastructure Policy Program, said he was surprised by the “clarity and intensity of Wray’s statements regarding this threat and how much more resources the Chinese Communist Party is putting into this relative to the United States.” He said that Wray, despite his stark language, may have underplayed the gravity of an issue that raises “a lot of warning signals regarding the potential threats to our critical infrastructure.” The scenario the FBI director painted in congressional testimony was a striking public accounting of the capacity of China, its Communist Party (CCP) leaders and sprawling intelligence agencies to target America’s way of life with a hacking operation that is bigger than that of all other nations combined. It raises the possibility that any conflict over Taiwan or territorial claims in the South China Sea that drags in the US could spread far beyond its epicenter on the other side of the globe. And it is a sign of the ambition and aggression of Xi Jinping’s China, which perceives an affront to its rightful power in American efforts to get it to submit to the existing US rules-based system. “The CCP’s dangerous actions, China’s multi-pronged assault on our national and economic security, make it the defining threat of our generation,” Wray said. “There has been far too little public focus on the fact that PRC hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure, our water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas pipelines, our transportation systems.” U.S. President Joe Biden meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Filoli estate on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Woodside, California, U.S., November 15, 2023. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Related article Exclusive: Xi promised Biden China wouldn’t interfere in 2024 election The specter of such a massive Chinese cyber-attack also underscores the extreme tensions beneath recent efforts to contain the plunge in US-China relations – and the depth of issues rocking the relationship. At their summit in November in California, Xi and President Joe Biden agreed to try to avoid flare-ups in a US election year. Xi promised Biden China wouldn’t interfere in the 2024 presidential election at that meeting, CNN reported exclusively this week. The high-level diplomatic contacts continued last week when national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bangkok. Wray also used the hearing before the House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party to cast doubt on Xi’s promise that China wouldn’t interfere in the election. His response, and the issue of potential cyberattacks, is likely to become an issue in the election itself as GOP candidates, especially ex-President Donald Trump, criticize Biden’s handling of the world’s most crucial diplomatic relationship and promise a harder line with Xi. Wray’s stunning warning Wray’s appearance on Capitol Hill marked the most significant moment yet for the committee, whose creation was one of the major legacy items from the short-lived Republican speakership of Kevin McCarthy. The challenge from an increasingly mighty China, which is reshaping global geopolitics, is one of the few policy areas on Capitol Hill where both parties share a common vision of a threat or problem and a desire for action. The committee’s chairman, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, warned that US intelligence agencies had discovered China had hacked into American critical infrastructure with the sole purpose of destroying or disabling it in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, for instance. “This is the cyberspace equivalent of placing bombs on American bridges, water treatment facilities and power plants,” he said. “There is no economic benefit for these actions. There’s no pure intelligence-gathering rationale. The sole purpose is to be ready to destroy American infrastructure, which would inevitably result in chaos, confusion and potentially mass casualties.” The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, called on the government to act to prevent “political, economic and social chaos” in the event of an attack. He cited a need to hunt and destroy malware and malicious code that China was inserting into critical US infrastructure, and to take steps to spell out how the US would deter such action. Wray warned that the purpose of such moves was to give China the capacity to exert harm deep in US society. “We can see from where they position themselves across civilian infrastructure that low blows aren’t just a possibility in the event of a conflict; low blows against civilians are part of China’s plan,” he said. Before the hearing, Wray announced that the bureau and its partners had shut down an operation by a state-sponsored Chinese hacking group known as Volt Typhoon, which involved malware that allowed China to penetrate communications, energy transport and water sectors, and he called on Congress to help disrupt future violations of US systems. There was no immediate response to the hearing from China but in the past the government in Beijing has denied hacking into US systems. It is also not possible to know the extent to which the US has its own capabilities to target China’s vital systems that might offer a measure of deterrence. But Gen. Paul Nakasone, commander of US Cyber Command, told the House committee that the US was seeking to maintain a strategic advantage by “contesting the threats posed by the PRC in cyberspace by using the full scope of our authorities and the full spectrum of our capabilities to impose costs, deny benefits, and encourage restraint on the part of our adversary.” How integrated systems raise the costs of catastrophic attacks Gallagher warned at the start of the hearing that without constant vigilance and US defensive action, China would maintain the capacity to “turn off the lights for everyday Americans, shut down cities and cause massive loss of American lives.” The problem is exacerbated by the interconnected nature of much of modern infrastructure. Geddes said that a “quiet infrastructure revolution” had taken place in the US, powered by small start-up companies whose systems were being adopted across US systems. “The policy issue is that there’s a lack of appreciation for how that integrates different sectors of infrastructure that prior to the technological development were independent, and you could think about them as being independent. Now they become more interdependent with one another,” he said. The effect of this, Geddes said, is that different networks can become vulnerable to a single attack. For example, the increasing use of electric vehicles might mean that a successful hack of the electrical grid could grind large parts of the transportation system to a halt in a way that could have disastrous impacts on daily life and the economy. Traffic signals are another example. In the past, they were often operated on a timer – meaning that they were not tied together. In modern systems, however, the signals are connected via computers. “If you have a cyberattack on that sort of technology, it could affect all signals at once,” Geddes said. This level of integration actually makes the country more vulnerable than it would have been. “One of the unintended consequences of this technological evolution is to make that integration more profound, but that implies to some degree it’s less resilient, and the effects of a successful cyberattack would be greater,” Geddes said. This reality gives an already sweeping Chinese hacking capability even greater power and scope."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/politics/union-voters-election-trump-biden/index.html,"CNN — Joe Biden and Donald Trump are tussling over the union vote. Biden, who is meeting with the United Auto Workers in Michigan on Thursday, finds himself trying to fend off Trump’s overtures to a traditionally Democratic constituency. Trump is meeting up with the Teamsters in Washington on Wednesday. Trump’s efforts seem to be paying off, polling data shows, as Biden fights against the long-term trends of union members shifting away from Democrats. Take a look at recent New York Times/Siena College polling in the six closest swing states that Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden and Trump were tied at 47% among union members when asked who they’d vote for in 2024. When these swing state voters were asked how they voted in 2020, Biden won the group by an 8-point margin. The union vote is especially important in Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Somewhere between 14% and 15% of employees in these three states are represented by unions . (Between 12% and 13% of employees in these states are themselves union members.) The latest polling may be a surprise given that union workers are generally thought of as a strong Democratic group. It shouldn’t be. Biden won union workers – who reside primarily in blue states – by 22 points, according to the 2020 Cooperative Election Study survey by Harvard University. Compare that with Bill Clinton’s performance in 1992 , when he won the national popular vote by a similar margin to Biden 28 years later. But Clinton won union members by 31 points, according to an American National Election Studies survey. President Joe Biden joins striking members of the United Auto Workers on the picket line outside a General Motros distribution center in Belleville, Michigan, in September 2023. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters/File We’re a far cry from 1948 , when Democrat Harry Truman won union workers by 62 points over Republican Thomas Dewey. Truman almost certainly wouldn’t have won the election that year without them. Truman, for those who don’t know, ran a very populist campaign against Dewey, the New York governor whom he portrayed as an elitist from the Republican “Eastern Establishment.” Today, a lot of Republicans, including Trump, try to appear as populists. Some of the movement among organized labor away from Democrats can, in fact, be attributed to larger forces affecting politics. Mainly the fact that non-college graduates of all stripes have become friendlier to the GOP. Indeed, Trump won non-college graduate union members by 6 points in 2020. Biden’s victory among union members was entirely attributable to those who had graduated college, winning them by 46 points. You might think this is a divide between the union bosses and the rank-in-file, though I’m not sure that’s entirely right. While people are most likely to think of a union worker as someone on an assembly line, the fact is that union workers are far likelier to be in education, training and library occupations (32.7%). Additionally, public sector employees are much likelier to be part of a union (32.5%) than private sector employees (6.0%). A protester with a bullhorn leads Rutgers students and faculty as they participate in a strike at the university's main campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in April 2023. Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty Images As the face of union workers has changed, so too has their place within the electorate. When Truman defeated Dewey, union workers represented about 30% of wage and salary workers. Today, they’re about 10%. The declining share of union members among the general workforce may lead you to believe they have declining influence. Perhaps that is the case, but remember also that elections today are closer than they have been at any point in our lifetimes. There hasn’t been a presidential election decided by double digits in the popular vote in the past 36 years. That’s the longest streak in American politics. Any small movement within any somewhat sizable voting bloc matters. Moreover, union members often lead get-out-the-vote efforts in pivotal battleground states. Motivating them can have an impact beyond just the votes of union members. This can also be seen in the fact that Americans hold largely favorable views of unions. About two-thirds of Americans approve of labor unions , which ranks among the highest percentages recorded since 1967. Just 15 years ago, only 48% of Americans approved of unions. In other words, it pays to be seen as friendly to labor unions even among those voters who are not members. Given these facts, as Biden and Trump appear to be heading toward a fall rematch, don’t expect them to stop courting union voters all the way through Election Day."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/politics/biden-middle-east-war-analysis/index.html,"Story highlights With a wider regional war raging in the Middle East, Biden's challenge is how to prevent dramatic escalation Neither Washington nor Tehran seems to want a full-scale regional war It's easy for Republicans to call for hitting Iran directly when they're not the ones in the White House CNN — US policy in the Middle East can no longer be described as an attempt to stop the Israel-Gaza conflict from triggering a bigger regional war. That hope died weeks ago. The critical task now for President Joe Biden — as he mulls retaliation over the deaths of three Americans in an attack by suspected Iranian proxy forces in Jordan Sunday – is to prevent that region-wide war from tipping out of control. The president told reporters on Tuesday that he had made a decision on how to respond to the attack and warned he held Tehran responsible “in the sense that they’re supplying the weapons to the people who did it.” But expressing the balancing act he faces in seeking to punish the perpetrators, downgrade their capabilities and restore deterrence, he added: “I don’t think we need a wider war in the Middle East. That’s not what I’m looking for.” But it is indisputable that the United States is already embroiled in a war in the wider Middle East, less than three years after Biden officially decreed the end of a two-decade-long combat mission in Iraq that exhausted the US and caused deep political trauma. It is also clear that the Biden administration’s effort to prevent an escalation is not working. US strikes against Iranian-backed militia throughout the region, which followed more than 160 attacks on American military facilities, did not deter Sunday’s drone strike. And missile and drone attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea haven’t stopped despite rolling US airstrikes against their launch sites and infrastructure in Yemen. So Biden has now arrived at the unenviable position that presidents often face when all potential options before them are bad and the very task of seeking to slow a deepening crisis may end up exacerbating it. In this photo posted to social media platform X on Monday, January 29, US President Joe Biden is briefed by members of his national security team in the Situation Room on the latest developments regarding the attack on US service members in northeastern Jordan. From President Joe Biden via X Related article Biden’s response to Jordan attack is likely to be powerful, but US is wary of triggering a wider war with Iran, officials say The catalogue of violence that has erupted outside Gaza – where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed after 1,200 Israelis died in Hamas terror attacks on October 7 – underscores the grave potential of the war. — Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group based in Lebanon, has been waging a low-grade war against Israel. On Monday alone, it said it had launched 13 attacks on targets in northern Israel. The Israel Defense Forces said that evening it carried out airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. — Two months of Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping have disrupted global supply chains and raised the cost of the cargo trade, risking a major economic impact. The US is leading a coalition of nations to protect trade. — The US and Britain launched strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen this month and Washington has carried out multiple follow-ups. But even Biden has admitted that the strategy has not stopped Houthi attacks. — The US also launched strikes against targets linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria. — The Biden administration has also carried out attacks on Iran-backed groups in Iraq, severely straining relations with the Baghdad government and raising concerns that US troops in the country to fight terrorism could be asked to leave. — Israel expanded its own war by carrying out a drone strike that killed a senior Hamas leader in Beirut, according to US officials, fueling tensions in Lebanon – a nation beset by severe economic, political and security crises. — Iran has blamed Israel for an attack that killed a number of Revolutionary Guard officers in Damascus, Syria. If there is an upside to this spiraling military activity it’s that, as serious as it is, it’s unfolding as a set of controlled escalations that has yet to acquire its own destructive momentum. Some worst-case scenarios haven’t occurred — for example, a massive onslaught of missile attacks by Hezbollah against Israeli cities. The group has a far greater capacity to hurt Israel than Hamas does. And while the weekend attack that killed the three Americans is tragic for their families and their nation, there has not so far been a large-scale attack on US interests — for instance, catastrophic damage to a US naval ship with huge loss of life — that could multiply the intensity of the conflict on multiple fronts. The calibrated escalations have fueled an impression in Washington that Iran doesn’t want a full-scale regional conflagration any more than its arch-enemy the United States does. But if the progression of the conflict has been steady, rather than sudden, it’s not a given that it will stay that way. “I think it’s very important to note that this is an incredibly volatile time in the Middle East,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, before adding: “I would argue that we have not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we’re facing now across the region since at least 1973, and arguably even before that.” Aaron David Miller, who spent years as a Middle East peace negotiator for presidents of both parties, is even less hopeful. He told CNN’s Jim Acosta on Sunday: “It’s going to get worse before it gets worse, I suspect.” Video Ad Feedback ""I don't envy the President's decision"", says Fmr. Republican Congressman 04:48 - Source: CNN Biden’s impossible choices As the country absorbed the loss of Sgt. William Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Moffett, 23, on Monday, Biden shared on social media a photo of him in the Situation Room after receiving a national security briefing. He doesn’t lack for advice outside the White House. Hawkish Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham are demanding he attack Iran on Iranian soil. GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley says he should target leaders of the IRGC. Biden’s likely 2024 election foe Donald Trump is simultaneously blasting Biden as weak and accusing him of dragging the US into another Middle Eastern quagmire. The ex-president is not that different from some progressives in voicing that fear. Also on the left, however, is dismay from some at Biden’s refusal to demand a ceasefire in Gaza. Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN’s “The Lead” Monday that Iran understood that there was always the risk of fatalities when its proxies attacked US bases. “A lot of us have spent time thinking what happens when there are fatalities and now we are in that world,” said the Connecticut lawmaker. “(The) response is going to be important and hopefully calibrated to send a very strong signal without increasing dramatically the odds that we get into a shooting war with Iran.” Many politicians, experts and commentators have repeatedly speculated about the options in the last 24 hours, often citing the idea that the US needs to send a tough message but must also avoid sending the conflict into an even worse place. But one lesson from the last few months, and indeed the disastrous last 20 years of US policy in the Middle East, is that formulations and assumptions that make sense in Washington rarely play out as anyone expects in that treacherous region. This is why Biden’s dilemma is so acute. How exactly does he find the sweet spot between deterrence and disastrous escalation? Will the reprisals he does take put US forces at even greater risk? Or will Iran just ignore them? Whenever a president takes military action, they must consider what’s next — not just how an adversary will respond immediately but in months to come and how the US is prepared to counter those reactions. US officials told CNN’s Oren Liebermann, Natasha Bertrand and Katie Bo Lillis Monday that the American response was likely to be more powerful than previous US strikes in Iraq and Syria against Iranian interests, but they have suggested it is unlikely the US will strike within Iran. Blinken on Monday predicted the US response would be “multileveled, come in stages and be sustained over time.” If there is one ray of light right now, it’s Monday’s news that a broad framework for a hostage release and potential ceasefire in the war in Gaza has been presented to Hamas. The emerged from proposals from Israel, Hamas, Qatar and Egypt along with additional ideas from the United States. It could see a six-week pause in the conflict, the freeing of civilian hostages in Gaza and corresponding releases of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Despite some reservations from Israel and tough details still pending, one official told CNN’s Alex Marquardt, “I sense optimism.” Such a critical diplomatic moment only raises the stakes for Biden not to upset things as he mulls his military options. The political context Biden’s decision making cannot be divorced from the political context at home. No president can afford to look like he’s lost control when US troops are dead. This is especially the case for Biden with accusations of weakness at the heart of Trump’s 2024 case against his successor. GOP critics have long accused Biden of appeasing the Islamic Republic and see recent events as the result. “The only answer to these attacks must be devastating military retaliation against Iran’s terrorist forces, both in Iran and across the Middle East. Anything less will confirm Joe Biden as a coward unworthy of being commander-in-chief,” said Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. Haley called on Biden to directly take aim at the IRGC leadership. “Find one or two of them that are making the decisions. It will chill all of them when you do that,” the former US ambassador to the United Nations said on Newsmax. The rationale for attacking Iran would be that incremental and calibrated attacks on Iranian proxies haven’t worked and that Iran is a mortal threat to the United States and its allies and could only be deterred by direct military action. Still, the lesson from Trump’s assassination of Iranian intelligence chef Qasem Soleimani in 2020 is that it didn’t prevent Iran from expanding its regional threat. Indeed the network of proxies threatening the US and its allies were the brainchild of Soleimani. And Trump didn’t dare to strike him inside Iran. The attack took place in Baghdad. There’s no sign the US will attack Iranian soil. The White House’s top national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters repeatedly on Monday the US has no interest in a war with Iran or its clerical regime. And the consequences of American strikes on Iran would likely be so escalatory — probably unleashing Tehran proxies like Hezbollah with full bore attacks on Israeli and US interests and a consequential major US-Iran war — that it’s an unthinkable possibility. It’s easy for Republicans – especially those like Haley, whose path to the White House looks dim — to advise hitting Iran. It’s Biden who will be responsible for the fallout. And on a purely strategic level, risking a major Middle East war that could cause massive US casualties to avenge the deaths of three soldiers, as terrible as their deaths are, would not represent a sound equation. While Beltway pundits speculated about sinking Iran’s navy or targeting its leadership, the most likely outcome is a range of punishing attacks against the capabilities of its proxies on a scale not yet seen. But Biden still must wrestle with this unanswerable question: How does he assert US power in a widening regional war in a way that doesn’t make the conflict even more dangerous, expansive and likely to careen out of control?

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/politics/donald-trump-washington-dc-2024-campaign/index.html,"CNN — Donald Trump is coming back to the place he hated to call home. The former president is due in the nation’s capital on Wednesday to address the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and will perhaps be collecting impressions for his next unflattering depiction of the city in a future campaign speech. Washington – with its gun crime and carjackings – has taken a starring role in the GOP front-runner’s 2024 stump speech as he tries to create a dystopian picture of a nation and its citadel trapped in the grip of lawlessness that requires a strongman’s attention . “You can’t walk down the streets of these cities these days without being shot or mugged or beat up or pushed into a subway train,” Trump said in a dark speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, on January 20. “We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild it. It’ll be a capital like no other.” Trump went on: “Our capital is a disgrace, I was there for one of these fake trials the other day a couple of weeks ago, and I’m driving down a major thoroughfare … and there was so much garbage that we were literally driving over cartons and boxes and cans of beer.” The former president was exaggerating the city’s current state, even though it does have its problems, especially since the pandemic. Trump has returned several times since his disgraced departure from the District as president in January 2021, when the US Capitol still bore the scars of his supporters’ mob invasion. He’s not been much missed in this overwhelmingly Democratic bastion. And the feeling is mutual. The ex-president has never hidden his disgust for the city where he slept – or tweeted late into the night – for parts of four years when he was the commander in chief. No modern president has been as visceral about Washington as Trump – and his contempt offers insight into his politics and his character. The ex-president’s core political project is dedicated to metaphorically tearing down a city that exists to provide governance. It’s the foundation of what ex-Trump political guru Steve Bannon calls the administrative state. If he’s elected to a second term, Trump has pledged to gut the professional civil service. Washington, in the eyes of Trump and his supporters, is the epicenter of a corrupt Deep State that is dedicated to destroying the “Make America Great Again” movement and is a playground for political and media elites. Washington’s marbled monuments have also been the been the backdrop for some of the most notorious moments of Trump’s political career and have highlighted his autocratic leanings. In his first hours as president, Trump’s false claims about the size of his inauguration crowd, sparsely stretched between the Capitol and the obelisk of the Washington Monument, were the first indication of how he’d use the White House to defile truth. Trump once took part in a Fox News interview inside the Lincoln Memorial, raising questions about his government’s easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions for the event. One of the darkest moments of his presidency came when Trump corralled members of his Cabinet and marched across Lafayette Square, shortly after it was cleared of racial injustice protesters, to St. John’s Church, where presidents-elect often worship before their inaugurations. In a bizarre photo-op, he then held up a Bible. A few days later, Washington’s Democratic leadership named a street plaza for the large yellow “Black Lives Matter” letters painted on 16th Street during the protests against the police killing of George Floyd. The installation in front of the White House is now one of the most visible, physical responses to Trump’s time in the Oval Office. Washington is still trying to forget the most chilling moment in modern presidential history, when Trump held a massive rally on the Ellipse on January 6, 2021, and told his crowd to “fight like hell” for their country before the mob ransacked the Capitol building in an attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. There have sometimes been suggestive racial overtones in Trump’s critique of Washington. In 2020, he tweeted that people protesting the death of Floyd would be met by “vicious dogs” if they breached the White House fence. For some Americans, this recalled the imagery of the Civil Rights movement and the suppression of protests against segregation in the Deep South. Washington’s Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, who frequently clashed with Trump, tweeted in response, “There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone…” Washington’s status as a Democratic city with a substantial minority population also appears to have been on Trump’s mind recently, given his pending trial for election subversion in federal court there. It’s fueled his claims that it will be impossible for him to get “even close to a fair trial.” He wrote on Truth Social last year, “There are many reasons for this, but just one is that I am calling for a federal takeover of this filthy and crime ridden embarrassment to our nation.” Hundreds of January 6 rioters have been tried and convicted in Washington ahead of Trump’s trial. But acceptance of his argument – that he can’t be fairly tried in the city for political reasons – would unravel the justice system. If politicians can choose their juries and judges in politically favorable jurisdictions, corruption would run rampant. One reason why the trial is set for Washington is it’s the city where the alleged offense – a crime against democracy – took place. Many presidents have hated Washington – but not like Trump Many previous presidents, especially Republicans, have long used Washington as a metaphor for all that is wrong with America. The city is an easy target in many federal campaigns, from both parties. And for all their efforts to get to the city as president, many commanders in chief often seem desperate to leave whenever they can. Franklin Roosevelt spent long periods at Warm Springs in Georgia, where he’d ease lifelong physical repercussions from polio and at his home at Hyde Park, New York. Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush were always keen to swap the White House for their Texas ranches. Trump made little effort to embrace the town, getting out to play golf at his course in Virginia or heading to his properties in Florida and New Jersey. Biden spends most weekends in his beloved Delaware. But Barack Obama bucked the trend, becoming the rare president to set up home in the capital after his tenure ended instead of returning to his previous adopted hometown, Chicago. Some presidents have tried to treat DC like home while in office. Theodore Roosevelt went rock climbing in Rock Creek Park, and decades later, Ronald Reagan saddled up to burnish his cowboy persona and went horse riding there. Abraham Lincoln used to escape the swampy summers to a cottage in Northwest DC where he’d also visit with wounded Civil War soldiers. And of course, he went to the theater at least once, with tragic results. John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, who served as naval officers, loved to take the presidential yacht, the USS Sequoia, down the Potomac River. The vessel was decommissioned by Jimmy Carter, a former submariner who was perhaps more comfortable beneath the waves. Nixon’s most lasting impact on Washington, however, was that he made the Watergate office complex famous after a raid by Republican operatives on the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee spawned a scandal that toppled him. In recent years, some Democratic presidents have adopted the city’s call for political self-determination, adding the slogan “No Taxation without Representation” to the license tags of the presidential limousine. The slogan was not, however, in evidence on the presidential ride Biden used in Florida on Tuesday, when – in a show of aviation one-up-man-ship – Air Force One taxied past Trump’s private Boeing in West Palm Beach. Presidents have also often ventured out of the White House for refreshment. Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Johnson, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt and Warren Harding are all said to have patronized Old Ebbitt Grill, which is open still just around the corner. During the Clinton and Obama administrations it was not unusual to see the presidential motorcade idling outside some of the city’s top restaurants in Georgetown and downtown. Trump, however, rarely went anywhere to socialize apart from his former hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, whose bars and restaurants became a hot spot for administration officials and Trump-world figures like Rudy Giuliani and a must-see for MAGA tourists in the capital. What Trump does love about Washington Trump may demonize the current conditions in Washington. But as a builder, he can’t help but admire its splendid architecture. In December 2020, he issued an executive order praising the capital’s unique real estate, noting that “President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson consciously modeled the most important buildings in Washington, D.C., on the classical architecture of ancient Athens and Rome.” The order added, with some irony given subsequent events, that the founders “sought to use classical architecture to visually connect our contemporary Republic with the antecedents of democracy in classical antiquity, reminding citizens not only of their rights but also their responsibilities in maintaining and perpetuating its institutions.” The order, a draft of which was titled “Make Federal Buildings Beautiful Again,” outlawed the use of modernist architecture in “ugly” and “uninspiring buildings” in the government in the future. A month later, when Trump left Washington as president for the last time, many of those classical buildings that he so admired, including the White House, were locked behind high iron fences to protect them from the dangerous political forces he helped to incite."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/politics/trump-border-middle-east-election/index.html,"CNN — Donald Trump’s core general election argument is that President Joe Biden is weak and incapable as events spin out of control at home and abroad. And he’s presenting himself as the strongman that America needs to save it. The former president spent Saturday night in Nevada lambasting his successor’s southern border policies, which he portrayed as a national security disaster waiting to happen. “There’s a 100% chance that there will be a major terrorist attack in the United States, so many attacks, maybe, and it’s all because of what’s happened over the last three years,” he said. And yet Trump is also trying to kill off a Senate compromise deal that might ease the situation on the border – a sign of his growing power in the GOP and of his tendency to exacerbate the kind of chaos he’s using as a rationale for his own election. The White House on January 26, 2024. Julia Nikhinson/Reuters Related article Biden risks deepening Middle East conflict with pressure to respond to deadly troop attack The ex-president was also quick to exploit another crisis for political gain on Sunday. After tragedy struck in the Middle East when three US troops were killed in a drone attack in Jordan, Trump put all the blame on Biden and his perceived lack of strength, claiming that current wars would never have happened if he were in the Oval Office. “(We) would right now have Peace throughout the World. Instead, we are on the brink of World War 3,” Trump said in a statement. His attacks represent gross simplifications of complex problems and an inflated sense of his own foreign policy, which was chiefly characterized by cozying up to dictators and excoriating US allies, while turning the United States – a source of global stability for decades – into a force for disruption. But Trump’s attacks do stress the real political peril Biden faces at home as he wrestles with the possibility that an expanding Middle Eastern war could drag the US back into a regional conflict. Trump’s demagogic descriptions of a border under siege and a world that is laughing at US weakness come at a moment when many Americans are concerned about migrant flows at the southern border – and when bewildering world events and challenges to US power are multiplying. The atmosphere of disorder that Trump is trying to foster also coincides with a feeling among some voters that the country’s on the wrong track – especially as high grocery prices and interest rates challenge many family budgets. Migrants wait in front of barbed wire as hundreds of migrants are attempting to reach the United States border to seek humanitarian asylum in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on December 29, 2023. Despite the efforts of the Texan National Guard, the migrants managed to traverse the river and overcome obstacles, including the barbed wire installed by the authorities. David Peinado/Anadolu/Getty Images Related article Biden seizes on tougher border measures as he tries to fend off Trump attacks So Trump’s picture of a world in disarray as Biden stands by helplessly may have some political potency. It is also intended to play into concerns about Biden’s age and anxiety among many Americans that the 81-year-old would be unfit to lead the US in a second term. Biden has tried to throw that back at Trump , raising questions about his temperament and mental acuity following the former president’s own recent string of campaign trail gaffes, some unhinged appearances outside courtrooms and a self-absorbed victory speech after the New Hampshire primary last week. How events abroad interrupted Biden’s campaign swing News of the US deaths in Jordan came with Biden on a weekend swing through South Carolina that included the most energetic campaigning of his reelection bid yet and his most intense attacks on his predecessor and want-to-be successor. On Saturday, Biden mocked Trump as a “loser,” apparently seeking to draw him into the kind of outraged reactions that could alienate critical swing voters. He visited a barber shop, a pair of churches and a dinner ahead of the state’s first-in-the-nation Democratic primary next weekend as he sought to shore up support from Black voters – a critical part of his coalition.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Jacquelyn Martin/AP Related article Biden seeks to bolster support from Black voters as he looks to general election But the awful news from the Middle East immediately overshadowed the trip. Biden asked for a moment of silence ahead of a Sunday lunch with a Baptist congregation for “three brave souls” the US lost in the Middle East. “We shall respond,” he vowed. The tragic interruption underscored how presidents seeking reelection must balance their duties with their political priorities and the way foreign crises can threaten their political fortunes. Biden’s position is especially acute, since the expanding crisis in the Middle East is occurring at the same time as the nettlesome domestic crisis over the southern border. Trump understands the president’s exposure well. After issuing a statement that offered “profound sympathies” to the families of the dead and prayers for the around 30 people wounded, he was quick to go on the offensive. “This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender,” Trump said. Trump’s final remaining GOP opponent, former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, also used the attack to criticize Biden as weak. Haley, whose husband is a serviceman overseas, demanded immediate action to deter Iran. “It shows that they would not be attacking our troops if Joe Biden weren’t so weak in his treatment of Iran. We should retaliate with the full force of American strength,” Haley said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went even further – demanding a US attack on Iran itself, an option that, if followed, could plunge the US into a disastrous war with a powerful adversary and set the region on fire. Trump is back as a major political force The intensification of the general election campaign confirms Trump’s return as a major political force following his first two wins in the GOP nominating race. But his hardline stance on immigration is also exposing the splits in the Republican Party as a group of senators pushes for an immigration enforcement deal that they can sell to voters in November. On Saturday night in Nevada – a key battleground – Trump described migrants, many of whom are fleeing political persecution and economic blight while seeking political asylum, as “criminals, rapists, murders, terrorists.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, left, listens while U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media while arriving to a Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, March 26, 2019. Trump last week intended to reverse sanctions imposed on two Chinese shipping companies accused of violating North Korea trade prohibitions, until officials in his administration persuaded him to back off and then devised a misleading explanation of his vague tweet announcing the move.

It’s not gonna happen. … I’ll fight it all the way,” Trump said. He also praised House Speaker Mike Johnson as “very tough” and backed the Louisiana Republican’s warning that the bill would be dead on arrival in the House. Biden, after months on the defensive on immigration, also sought to exploit the issue over the weekend. He heaped pressure on Republicans to pass the bill in repudiation of the ex-president, saying it would give him “emergency authority to shut down the border until it can get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I’d shut down the border right now and fix it quickly.” One of the president’s allies in the Senate predicted Sunday that the border deal could be ready this week. “I was glad to hear the president come out and speak forcefully in favor of this bill. I’m hopeful that we will still have enough Republicans in the Senate who want to fix the problem at the border rather than just to do Donald Trump’s bidding, but we will see over the next 24 to 48 hours whether that’s true,” Democratic Sen. Christopher Murphy of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” The showdown has also revived the long antagonism between the ex-president and key Senate leaders such as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and could foreshadow the disarray that could unfold in a second Trump administration. But given the power of pro-Trump lawmakers in the House and the pressure Trump’s piling on Johnson, it’s almost impossible to see a path through Congress for the compromise. That would be terrible news for Ukraine as the immigration package is being linked to Biden’s latest request for $60 billion in aid for Kyiv’s effort to repel Russia’s invasion. Trump also opposes that measure – in another sign of how his return to the center of Washington’s political universe is already having global ramifications. Biden kicks campaign into high gear Biden’s most biting attacks yet on Trump were on display when he brought up the ex-president’s refusal to visit a military ceremony in France while he was in office. Trump has denied calling US war dead “suckers and losers,” but Biden seized on the controversy in a state where the military and veterans play a huge role. “The only loser I see is Donald Trump,” Biden said, “It makes me angry.” The president also highlighted Trump’s recent apparent mix-up of Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as he raised questions about the former president’s acuity, turning Trump’s claims that he is incapable back against his 77-year-old rival.

It remains to be seen whether voters will buy into the image Biden and his team are trying to paint of Trump. But his reemergence as the GOP’s likely nominee is also highlighting the extraordinary liabilities that he would carry into a general election. The stunning spectacle on Friday, for example, of a jury deciding he should pay $83 million for defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll , whom he was already found liable of sexually abusing and defaming in another civil case, exemplified the extreme legal threats facing the ex-president and the character issues that alienated suburban voters in 2020 during his election loss . That case came to a conclusion with Washington still braced from an appeals court ruling on Trump’s expansive claims of presidential immunity that could help decide whether his federal election interference case – one of four looming criminal trials – goes ahead before Election Day in November."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/27/politics/texas-border-supreme-court-what-matters/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week he will continue to defend his state’s border despite a 5-4 Supreme Court order that the US Border Patrol can take down razor wire Texas set up along portions of the US border with Mexico. Questioning the court’s action, the Republican governor criticized its lack of clarity when it sided with the Biden administration , which wants to remove the razor wire while a legal challenge to Abbott’s actions plays out. “There were no sentences, or paragraphs or pages of an opinion written by the Supreme Court, so no one knows at all what they were thinking – all we know is that they wanted to send it back to the 5th Circuit,” Abbott said on Fox News , arguing, “There was no opinion about anything – about razor wire, what Texas is doing or anything like that.” The razor wire issue is playing out as part of a larger standoff in which Abbott argues by not acting more forcefully at the border, the federal government has violated its responsibility to protect the state from “invasion.” Is this a governor essentially ignoring the Supreme Court? Why is the federal government in charge of border policy in the first place? I went to CNN’s Supreme Court analyst Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, with those questions. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below. Abbott is not ignoring the Supreme Court WOLF: How does Abbott justify essentially ignoring the Supreme Court? VLADECK: It’s really important to stress that two different things are true: First, Abbott is not “essentially ignoring” the Supreme Court. Second, he is interfering with federal authority to a degree we haven’t seen from state officials since the desegregation cases of the 1950s and 1960s. With regard to the court, all that the justices did on Monday was to vacate a lower-court injunction, which had itself prohibited federal officials from cutting or otherwise removing razor wire that Texas officials have placed along or near the US-Mexico border. Nothing in Monday’s unexplained order stops Abbott from doing anything; it just means the federal government can’t be sanctioned by courts if it takes steps to remove those obstacles. Instead, the real issue here is that Abbott is deliberately impeding the ability of federal officials to act in and around Eagle Pass – in a way that isn’t in outright defiance of the Supreme Court (yet), but that is inconsistent with the supremacy of federal law. That’s why Abbott is trying to invoke a claim that the federal Constitution itself authorizes what he’s doing, because if the Constitution doesn’t empower him to take these steps, then “preemption” (the idea that federal statutes and federal policies promulgated pursuant to those statutes override contrary state laws and policies) should be the whole ballgame here. Abbott misuses the Constitution to declare an ‘invasion’ WOLF: Abbott has tried to justify his actions at the border by declaring an “invasion” in Texas. That language has been used for political reasons by Republican lawmakers. But it also has legal importance in the Constitution. Is the Supreme Court likely to agree with him? VLADECK: No. The actual provision Abbott is purporting to rely on is part of Article I, § 10, which limits states’ powers. And it prohibits states from “engag[ing] in war” without congressional consent “unless actually invaded.” The point of this provision – adopted at a time when we had a tiny federal army, Congress was usually out of session and travel took weeks – was to allow states to defend themselves from foreign invaders until federal authorities arrived. It was never understood, and has never been understood, to allow states to interfere with or otherwise override federal law enforcement – even if it’s an “invasion” (which, it should be said, this isn’t). Were it otherwise, states could use their own claim of being “invaded” as a justification to resist whatever federal laws and policies that they didn’t like – a modern-day version of the “nullification” arguments that didn’t survive the Civil War. Abbott does have a point on one thing WOLF: Does Abbott have a point about the lack of clarity in the court’s ruling? When we last we spoke, it was about your own research on the shadow docket and the problem of the court wielding power without writing decisions. VLADECK: Yes. One of the real issues with the Supreme Court handing down such significant rulings without explanation, as I write about in “The Shadow Docket,” is the lack of guidance it provides to government officials, lower courts and the public about what is and what is not allowed going forward. Unfortunately, Monday’s ruling is a perfect example. Abbott is, quite obviously, provoking a fight over how far states can go to supplant, and not just supplement, federal law enforcement authority. Until and unless the Supreme Court conclusively answers that question, we’re going to be in this limbo – with the unseemly prospect of a physical standoff between state and federal officials in Texas while that question goes unanswered. Who is supposed to be in charge of immigration policy? WOLF: Why is it that immigration policy is set aside for the federal government? VLADECK: I don’t think it’s quite right to say that “immigration policy [is] set aside for the federal government.” The Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate naturalization, which the Supreme Court has long interpreted to also include a power to regulate immigration and border security. But the Constitution leaves the extent of federal involvement almost entirely up to Congress. So part of the issue here is that, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, Congress has passed a number of statutes that themselves give the federal government a dominant role in both setting and implementing immigration policy. And once Congress has legislated, those statutes – and their enforcement – take constitutional precedence over any state policy to the contrary, no matter how much we might prefer what a state is doing to what the federal government is doing. As Justice Robert Jackson wrote for the Supreme Court in 1954, courts “cannot resolve conflicts of authority by our judgment as to the wisdom or need of either conflicting policy. The compact between the states creating the Federal Government resolves them as a matter of supremacy. However wise or needful [a state’s] policy, … it must give way to the contrary federal policy.” If we don’t like federal policy, the answer is to change it, not to let states override it. Congress keeps failing to act. Is this their fault? WOLF: There is a larger issue with our duct-taped immigration policy. Congress has been trying and failing for decades to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which has left the federal bureaucracy and the courts to fill in the blanks on outdated laws. Would a new comprehensive law solve the problem of these standoffs between border states and Democratic administrations? National Guard soldiers stand guard on the banks of the Rio Grande river at Shelby Park on January 12, 2024 in Eagle Pass, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Related article This is why nothing gets done in Congress on border policy VLADECK: There’s no question that Congress’ inability to enact comprehensive immigration reform is part of the issue here – because that gap has given presidents (of both parties) far more control over the contours of immigration policy than they would have if Congress were more invested in it. That, in turn, has led to far sharper conflicts between red states and Democratic presidents and between blue states and Republican presidents. And the fact that congressional Republicans at this exact moment are backing away from immigration reform because they’d rather run on border issues than fix them says a lot about both why Congress hasn’t solved these issues and why states are now (wrongly) taking it upon themselves to try to do so, or at least to try to look like they’re doing so. Is this a trend? WOLF: I am reminded of last year when Alabama legislators initially did not comply with a Supreme Court decision requiring a second majority-Black congressional district. The cases are different in many ways, but is there any similarity in the spirit of pushback against the court by Republican state officials? Is this a new phenomenon? VLADECK: As I’ve written for my Supreme Court newsletter , I don’t think it’s right to say that Alabama didn’t “comply” with the court’s ruling in Allen v. Milligan; they just tried to make an argument on remand that Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh had brought up but not addressed at the time of the court’s decision. Just like Abbott and Monday’s ruling, I don’t chalk either of these cases up to direct defiance of the court. That said, the calls we’ve seen this week from Republican elected officials at both the state and federal level to ignore the Supreme Court (which are also premised on a misunderstanding of what the court did and didn’t do) are more than a little alarming – and evidence of how the Supreme Court’s declining public credibility has ramifications not just for left-wing critics of the court, but for right-wing critics, too. It says a lot about where we are that even this Supreme Court isn’t far enough to the right to satisfy these politicians – and it says a lot about the costs of the eroding public confidence in the court that attacking the court from the right is becoming increasingly popular. Indeed, we’re seeing in real time exactly why it’s important for the court to have broad-spectrum support: So that if and when it does need to intervene more aggressively in disputes like the current conflict between the federal government and Texas, there are no serious doubts that it can and should resolve them. How would the court treat Trump’s promise of mass deportations? WOLF: Anything Republican governors are doing vis-a-vis the border should, I think, be viewed in the context of how a second Trump administration might play out . He has promised, for instance, mass deportations and camps modeled on the horribly named “Operation Wetback” of the 1950s. How do you think the court might view such a mass deportation effort? VLADECK: The reality, for better or worse, is that the Supreme Court has historically shown broad deference to executive branch immigration policies without regard to whether those policies were set by Democratic or Republican presidents. In a second Trump administration, I expect that the most serious challenges would be to how these policies infringed upon the rights of immigrants – as opposed to current challenges to the Biden administration, which are framed more in terms of federalism and states’ rights. To that end, I think the real precedent that these current disputes are going to set, one way or the other, is whether states really can have what are effectively their own immigration policies – whether because of a twisted reading of the “actually invaded” language of Article I, § 10 of the federal Constitution, or because the current Supreme Court is going to rein in the scope of federal preemption. The court’s 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States , in which a 5-3 majority sided with the federal government to block most of an Arizona law that tried to create a form of state immigration policy, is looming increasingly large. But if what Texas is doing leads courts to give states more leeway to interfere with federal immigration policy, it’s hard to see why blue states won’t follow that roadmap during a second Trump administration. In the end, federalism isn’t partisan – which is exactly why those who are sympathetic to what Texas is doing as a matter of policy should nevertheless be more than a little alarmed by what it is doing as a matter of fundamental constitutional principles of federalism."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/trump-strongman-power-gop-analysis/index.html,"CNN — Donald Trump is moving to assert total dominance over the Republican Party in a harbinger of the strongman rule he envisages for his possible second term, following his twin triumphs in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Trump’s supporters launched a bid to jolt the Republican National Committee to anoint him presumptive nominee after only two nominating races — until Trump backtracked amid concern from his allies it could backfire. And the 45th president is now pressuring GOP members of Congress to kill an immigration deal to deprive President Joe Biden of a victory and to ensure he can exploit the border crisis on the campaign trail. Trump has also been browbeating former opponents and key decision makers in the GOP to quickly endorse him as he forces the party to genuflect before him as he did during four years in the White House.

He was twice impeached in his single term, which ended after he tried to overturn an election in which voters ejected him from office. It is consistent with Trump’s self-created persona as the strongest person in every room that sustained him through a life in business, reality television and as an ex-president. Among Trump’s critics, his behavior is stirring fresh concerns that his potential second term could mean a dawn of autocracy in the Oval Office. And Trump’s desire to pressure Haley out of the race after only two contests – while he leads in the delegate count 32 to 17, out of the 1,215 needed for the GOP crown – is consistent with his disrespect for democratic processes. The former president is not hiding his intent. He has frequently warned, for instance, that he would dedicate a second term to exacting “retribution” on his enemies. Almost every day he demands full criminal immunity for presidents, partly as an effort to avoid prosecution for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election but also to permit him to behave exactly as he pleases in a possible second term with no risk of consequences. In a rally Saturday night in Manchester, New Hampshire, that pulsated with aggressive imagery, the ex-president praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as a “great man.” Orbán has methodically eroded political freedoms, cracked down on the independent press, and discredited the electoral system, the courts and alternative sources of power. He’s regarded by many “Make America Great Again” supporters as a hero and a model. “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong. It’s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected. His comments cemented an impression that Orbán may be a better prototype for the authoritarian leader that the ex-president would like to become than the extreme 1930s European dictators to which his recent rhetoric, toward immigrants especially, has drawn comparisons. Trump’s impatience is creating political risks for his campaign The former president’s autocratic instincts are one reason why the coming election promises to be one of the most fateful in modern American history. But there are also risks for Trump in his truculent approach. By throwing his weight around he could confirm Biden’s arguments that he’d endanger democracy if elected to a second term in November. And the bullying approach and sexist language he’s using toward Haley could alienate some of the more moderate, independent, suburban voters that she’s attracting in the GOP primary. These are exactly the kinds of voters that Trump alienated in his 2020 defeat. If he’s to win another term, he must at least mitigate his deficit to Biden among this group in November. Katon Dawson, a former chairman of the South Carolina GOP, noted the potential consequences of Trump’s behavior in an interview with Kasie Hunt on “State of the Race” on CNN International and CNN Max on Thursday. Dawson, one of the few Palmetto State GOP heavyweights supporting Haley, warned that Trump would “polarize” women in South Carolina with his “seedy little comments about what Nikki had on.” He added: “Donald Trump is running more like he wants to be the President of Cuba instead of the President of the United States.” Haley might not have beaten Trump in Iowa or New Hampshire. But she provoked him by refusing to quickly fold her campaign and endorse him like other GOP candidates, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Trump’s fury was revealed in a self-absorbed victory speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. Haley’s mockery of that performance has infuriated the former president even more. “We did our thing and we said what we had to say and then Donald Trump got out there and just threw a temper tantrum,” Haley said in Charleston on Wednesday. “He pitched a fit. He was insulting. He was doing what he does, but I know that’s what he does when he’s insecure.” Trump has appeared deeply frustrated that Haley is defying his calls for her to leave the race, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins has reported. During his New Hampshire speech, he mocked the dress she wore on caucus night in Iowa. He has been calling her “birdbrain” on social media. Trump has also warned that anyone who makes a financial contribution to her will be “barred from the MAGA camp” – which Haley has turned around into a fundraising pitch for her campaign.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images Related article Trump comes out against draft RNC resolution from supporter declaring him presumptive nominee It is not surprising that there have been calls for Haley to end her campaign, given the size of her defeats to Trump and the fact that New Hampshire, where independents can vote in the GOP primary, was her best shot at a win. Parties generally like to consolidate quickly behind a nominee to look ahead to a general election once the destiny of the primary race becomes obvious. But the disdain toward Haley from Trump world is remarkable. For instance, even before all the polls had closed on Tuesday night, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, one of Trump’s top supporters, issued a statement saying Haley’s campaign “must end” after the ex-president’s “monumental” victory “for the sake of the republic.” The history of past campaigns suggests that restraint and respect might be more effective in prodding Haley out of the race than threats. And while her prospects appear grim, the idea that a candidate should abandon a campaign after just two contests in a nationwide primary season just because the front-runner says so is in itself an affront to a democratic process.

The former president on Thursday came out against an RNC draft resolution that would have declared him the presumptive nominee — a move that would have allowed him access to the RNC’s data and fundraising operation. It would have essentially joined the party’s forces with Trump while an election involving a rival was still taking place. But Trump wrote on Truth Social that while he appreciated the RNC’s “respect and devotion,” he wanted to win the “old fashioned way,” at the ballot box. While the campaign had initially approved of the resolution and Trump himself was on board, that changed when a backlash ensued, a source familiar told Collins. The resolution was withdrawn later Thursday. Trump seeks to squash immigration deal The former president, whose business career was mythologized in “The Art of the Deal,” is more concerned currently with the art of killing a deal – one being painfully pieced together by Republican and Democratic senators to address a southern border crisis. Trump has been lobbying Republicans in both private conversations and public statements on social media to oppose the deal because he wants to campaign on the issue this year and ensure Biden doesn’t get a legislative victory that could ease pressure at the border and help his reelection, sources said.

Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic.” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump antagonist who’s not running for reelection, said that if Trump sabotaged the deal just to blame Biden, it would be “appalling.” Trump and his acolytes on Capitol Hill have also made clear their opposition to Biden’s latest $60 billion aid package for Ukraine, which is running out of bullets and ammunition. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has been heavily involved in both the immigration and Ukraine discussions, raised concerns that the looming shadow of one man – who doesn’t currently hold any governing role – could overwhelm a branch of the US government. “I hope we don’t live in a world today in which one person inside the Republican Party holds so much power that they could stop a bipartisan bill to try to give the president additional power at the border to make more sense of our immigration policy,” Murphy told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I would hope that one person isn’t so powerful inside the Republican Party to hand Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, but we’ll find out the answer to that.”"

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here . CNN — If Punxsutawney Phil saw no shadow, suggesting an early spring, will Americans look at these new bonkers jobs numbers and begin to warm up to “Bidenomics?” Americans have for years expressed a general discomfort with the state of the economy, which has helped drag down President Joe Biden’s objectively pathetic approval rating. Despite gloomy perceptions of the economy, people have not stopped spending money, which has buoyed many of the economic indicators that please policymakers. Evidence of a strong economy has so far been lost on a general public that still feels the pinch of inflation and worries about the uncertainty of life in 2024. Jobs, jobs, jobs Data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged US job growth at 353,000 jobs in January , a stunning figure that doubled economists’ projections. The unemployment rate held at 3.7% and has now been under 4% for two full years. Employment data is but one indicator. There are others to choose from. The S&P 500, the stock index that tracks the largest publicly traded companies, has been on a record-setting tear , strengthening the balances of many people’s 401(k)s. Not enough credit, too much blame The old political adage is that presidents get too much blame for bad economies and not enough credit for strong economies. The coming general election, shaping up to be a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump , offers voters alternate realities to choose from. Biden and his surrogates are bragging about the economy and trying to convince voters that “Bidenomics,” a term the administration’s embraced, is working. Trump wants credit for Biden’s economy Trump, meanwhile has said the economy would tumble and hopes it will happen on Biden’s watch rather than his own. He said the stock market is booming because of the prospect of his victory. And he’s promoting conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve considering rate cuts to favor Biden. Instead, as inflation has cooled, the Fed has held rates steady , as it did this week, and transmitted that people should not expect rate cuts in March either. Everyone from investors to progressive senators are hoping for rate cuts to give people cheaper access to borrowed money and, among other things, unlock the real estate market. But Fed officials clearly want to be more certain that inflation is more under control. Their target for inflation is 2%, and recent reports suggest prices have steadied. Predicted recession has not come Rather than suffer the recession that was widely predicted coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy had a shockingly strong year in 2023 and is expected to grow at an even stronger 4.2% rate in the first quarter . But that doesn’t mean things are getting cheaper. Americans are still feeling the pinch at the grocery store and everywhere else they spend money. Signs of a thaw in public opinion, but pessimism still dominates A new CNN poll shows Biden still has a lot of convincing to do: Perception of the economy remains deep under water. But the mood is heading in a positive direction – which should come as a relief to Biden, because the economy is one of his weakest issues, according to favorability polls. However, if hiring remains strong and inflation keeps falling, it may become easier for Biden to convince voters he’s doing a good job strengthening the economy. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that about half the country, 48%, thinks the economy remains in a downturn. Only 35% of Americans say that things in the country today are going well, which is actually an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall. She adds that while just 26% of Americans say they feel the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past few years, that’s also up from 20% last summer and 17% in December 2022. Frustration with affordability continues The Fed’s work to control inflation was always billed as tough medicine, and there’s growing frustration with it. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic senators told policymakers in a letter Sunday that they also have a duty to acknowledge that “astronomical” mortgage rates are fueling a housing affordability crisis. “We urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market and to reverse the troubling rate hikes that have put affordable housing out of reach for too many,” Warren and fellow Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse wrote. Their letter is proof that the fact of a strong economy is felt, if at all, in different ways. Anyone hoping to buy or sell a house is not likely to say this is a great economy. Anyone in a sector, like tech , which has suffered massive layoffs, is not likely to say this is a great economy. And anyone who still feels like eggs are more expensive than they used to be may wonder how this can be a great economy."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/desantis-exit-haley-trump-analysis/index.html,"Manchester, New Hampshire CNN — And then there was one. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ withdrawal from the GOP presidential race Sunday placed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the kind of one-on-one match-up with Donald Trump that his Republican opponents have been thirsting for since the 2016 primary race. But even that looks unlikely to slow the former president’s march to his third consecutive GOP nomination. DeSantis’ support in New Hampshire and South Carolina – the most important next states on the calendar – had dwindled to the point where his exit isn’t likely to significantly change the balance between Trump and Haley in those contests. The real impact of DeSantis’ decision to quit may be that his endorsement of Trump – whom he had criticized with growing ferocity in the past few weeks – may reinforce the signal that almost all of the GOP leadership wants to wrap up the race so the party can focus on the general election against President Joe Biden. That message has already been sent by the quickening procession of GOP senators and governors who have endorsed Trump in the past few weeks. Video Ad Feedback Nikki Haley reacts to DeSantis suspending his campaign 01:38 - Source: CNN If Haley doesn’t win New Hampshire, the chorus of Republicans demanding that she concede to Trump may grow deafening. The dynamic is reminiscent of the rapid coalescing behind Biden in the 2020 Democratic race, which abruptly ended the contest just days after he recovered from dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire to win the South Carolina primary. The DeSantis and Haley camps each believed they would benefit if the other left the field and created an unambiguous one-on-one race with Trump. That, of course, was the dream of Trump’s opponents in the 2016 contest. If that winnowing had occurred early in the 2016 race, it might have been a problem for Trump at a time when he could not expand his support beyond about 40% of the party. But it’s far less clear that such consolidation will hurt Trump now.

Matt Rourke/AP Related article Haley is now the last obstacle to Trump claiming the GOP nomination With DeSantis out, there’s no guarantee his supporters will mostly migrate to Haley. In fact, both the Trump and DeSantis campaigns believe that more of the Florida governor’s supporters will likely pick Trump. (A CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire released Sunday found that Trump’s lead over Haley in the state grew slightly from 11 to 13 percentage points without DeSantis in the race.) DeSantis gave that process a nudge with his withdrawal video on Sunday in which he was much more energetic in denouncing Haley than praising the former president. Any gain or loss for Haley among voters from DeSantis’ decision seems likely to affect the race only marginally, many GOP observers believe. The core issue for Republicans remains the same with two candidates in the race or three, said Whit Ayres, a longtime GOP pollster skeptical of Trump. “I don’t think it matters a whole lot,” Ayres said shortly before DeSantis’ withdrawal. “This whole party is defined so much by your attitude toward Donald Trump – whether you want to go with him again or whether you want to try something different.” As New Hampshire prepares to vote, it’s clear the chances of denying Trump the nomination are dwindling under any circumstance. By every measure, Trump is a much more formidable opponent than he was in 2016, and even then, his nearest competitor, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, won only 12 states against him. Trump won over 50% of the vote in Iowa last week, and in most late polls ( including the new CNN poll ), he appears poised to crack that impressive threshold again in New Hampshire. In 2016, by contrast, Trump did not reach 50% of the vote in any state until his home state of New York in mid-April. Even at that point in the 2016 race, Trump had won only a cumulative 40% of the votes cast in the GOP primaries. Video Ad Feedback George Conway predicts what Trump will do if he starts losing 01:10 - Source: CNN Compared with 2016, “Trump has a lot more overall popularity” in the party, said David Kochel, an Iowa-based GOP strategist. “His share of the party in ‘16 was in the 30% to 35% range that was just going to be with him, ride or die. That is now much bigger and that’s in part because he’s been a big part of the entrance into the party of all these White working-class voters” who are now supporting him in big numbers. Trump won a resounding two-thirds of voters without a college degree in the Iowa caucuses, according to the entrance polls , and leads Haley among them by 20 percentage points in the CNN poll in New Hampshire. DeSantis entered the race with a huge tailwind of interest from conservative leaders open to moving on from Trump, particularly after the former president’s endorsed candidates fared so poorly in the key swing states during the 2022 election. But the spectacular failure of DeSantis’ campaign – and the precarious position that Haley finds herself in even with him gone – demonstrates how difficult it is to pry the modern Republican coalition loose from Trump’s iron grip. Throughout the race, DeSantis and Haley have looked as if they were trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces missing – or, more precisely, in the hands of a third player who has no interest in sharing them. Trump’s unshakeable hold on his core constituency of non-college-educated and nonurban Whites makes every attempt to build a coalition large enough to defeat him a perplexing exercise. Not only is Trump’s support among those voters in most polls even greater now than it was in 2016, there’s evidence that they may constitute a larger share of the primary electorate than they did then as Trump draws in more blue-collar voters and alienates more of those with advanced education.

Matt Rourke/AP Related article CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire When DeSantis entered the race last year, he was not only considered the strongest potential challenger to Trump. The Florida governor and his team also articulated the clearest strategy for how to beat him. Wherever possible, DeSantis positioned himself to Trump’s right, in the hope of cracking the former president’s hold on the most conservative elements of their party. His camp’s vision was that DeSantis would build his support from the right toward the middle. If DeSantis could attract enough voters on the right to emerge as the last remaining viable alternative to Trump, they believed, more centrist GOP voters uneasy about the former president would eventually rally around the Florida governor, even if they bridled at some of his policy positions. DeSantis’ descent in the polls through the second half of 2023 showed the limitations of that approach. No matter how hard he championed the latest wave of conservative cultural causes, and no matter how vehemently he claimed that conservatives could not fully trust Trump, DeSantis made little progress at eroding Trump’s base. “He was very focused on these weird niche issues that may play on conservative Twitter but don’t play with regular Republican voters,” said Alex Stroman, a former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party who’s supporting Haley. But by positioning himself so far to the right, DeSantis simultaneously alienated many of the voters in the center of the GOP coalition most open to a Trump alternative. Unable to draw enough conservatives from Trump, and unacceptable to too many centrists, DeSantis was left with too narrow a coalition to truly threaten the front-runner. The entrance poll at the Iowa caucuses last week conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN measured that failure. Among the nearly half of Iowa voters who identified as part of Trump’s MAGA movement, DeSantis attracted just 11% – a testament to his inability to break into the former president’s base. But DeSantis also won only 30% of the voters who did not identify with the MAGA movement, finishing behind Haley. That testified to DeSantis’ retreat among the voters most open to replacing Trump. Video Ad Feedback CNN political director explains what went wrong for DeSantis 01:45 - Source: CNN DeSantis drew plenty of criticism for his performance on the campaign trail and in debates, but noticeably improved as the race went on. As the Iowa results demonstrated, the problem that doomed his campaign was not so much one of execution but of conception. His theory that he could peel away a meaningful number of previous Trump voters simply proved wrong. “DeSantis had the opportunity in the beginning … and he made a strategic mistake,” said longtime GOP strategist Scott Reed, who served as the campaign manager in Bob Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign. “He tried to out-Trump Trump. Instead of trying to be his own guy based on his success in Florida and taking that nationally. He is going to go down as the John Connally of this cycle.” That was a reference to the highly touted former Texas governor who raised what were enormous sums for the time in the 1980 Republican presidential race and then flamed out while winning only a single delegate. Haley’s camp has never publicly articulated a theory about how to beat Trump as definitive as that put forward by DeSantis. Her initial opening in the race derived from DeSantis’ choice to run so resolutely to Trump’s right. That left a vacuum among the segments of the GOP coalition most consistently dubious of Trump – especially moderates, college-educated suburbanites, and Republican-leaning independents.

Jewel Samad/AMAD/AFP/Getty Images Related article What to know about New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary Haley emerged as the choice for many of those voters through her strong performances in the early Republican debates, especially her skilled and contemptuous takedowns of entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who was running as virtually a Trump surrogate. But Haley has struggled to find a clear message that would allow her to reach much beyond that base – which is not big enough to win – or even to maximize her support within it. Throughout her campaign, she has been extremely cautious about drawing contrasts with Trump. She has always appeared most comfortable differentiating from him on grounds that imply no moral judgment against him: Her central arguments have been that she is more electable than him, and that it is time for a generational transition. Her bet has seemed to be that if she survived long enough to become the last alternative to Trump, she could peel away some of his soft supporters who favored his policies but not his demeanor and behavior. “There are a lot of Republicans across the country who may have liked a lot of Donald Trump’s policies but they didn’t like the way he did things,” Stroman said. Starting with her speech after the caucuses Monday night, Haley has somewhat turned up the heat on Trump, linking him to Biden as two aged symbols of a divisive past. But many of the Republicans who want to stop Trump fear she has not pressed that message with anything like the urgency required to dislodge his big lead. Even in this critical week before the New Hampshire vote, she has conspicuously refused to criticize Trump when asked about the civil judgment of sexual abuse against him in the E. Jean Carroll case and his false birther-style claims about her. (Haley, whose parents are Indian immigrants, is a natural-born American citizen.) “Her on-again, off-again criticism of Donald Trump has been a dizzying Charleston dance of incomprehensible footwork, carefully criticizing him one moment and lavishly praising him another,” the longtime GOP strategist Mike Murphy, who has become a fierce Trump critic, wrote last week . “It has only fed perceptions of her as a pliable politician willing to say anything to fearfully inch ahead.” Video Ad Feedback Haley goes after Trump and Biden: We don't need two 80-year-olds in the White House 01:31 - Source: CNN Haley’s nuanced and muffled approach to Trump has left her, like DeSantis, caught in a squeeze-through from the opposite direction. He forfeited the center and then failed to crack the right; she lost the right early on, and has failed to consolidate enough of the center. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the intensity of Trump’s attacks on her as “weak” and “liberal” – particularly on immigration – Haley struggled badly with conservatives in Iowa and in the New Hampshire polling this week. She has polled much better in the center of the party, but not nearly well enough to truly threaten Trump. The principal reason she fell to third place in the Iowa caucuses was that she failed to generate enough turnout in the white-collar urban and suburban areas where she was strongest. For instance, in Polk County, the state’s largest, she won only a little over half as many votes as Sen. Marco Rubio did when he appealed to a similar coalition in the 2016 GOP race. Though the brutal weather conditions depressed participation everywhere in Iowa, turnout compared with 2016 fell even more in those well-educated larger counties than it did in the blue-collar smaller places where Trump thrived. Many observers sympathetic to Haley fear a similar problem in New Hampshire. Even as Trump pounds her among conservatives, her careful messaging about him seems unlikely to generate the massive turnout among center-left independent voters – or “undeclared voters” as they are known here – that she would need to achieve an upset. “In my opinion, she’s not doing what she needs to do to connect with independent voters,” said Mike Dennehy, a longtime New Hampshire GOP strategist, who was the state director for John McCain’s upset victory in the 2000 primary here. Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has also become a resolute opponent of Trump, sees a more positive possibility for Haley. DeSantis quitting the race, Kristol said, might cause voters disappointed in Haley to recognize that the race has now become a binary referendum on whether to pick Trump again. “Maybe just the dynamics of the race are making it a more stark choice than she herself says it is,” Kristol said. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP/Getty Images/Will Lanzoni/CNN Related article If the New Hampshire primary results match latest polling, only one question will be asked The fact that two candidates as different as DeSantis and Haley have faced such similar dilemmas running against Trump suggests that their difficulties are less a function of their faults than his strengths in the party. At a rally with Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz on Sunday at Trump’s Manchester, New Hampshire, headquarters, voter after voter said they had never seriously considered any of the Republican alternatives to Trump. “I would listen to what they had to say, but never entertained it,” said Ginger Heald, the chair of the Merrimack Republican Town Committee. “I never changed my mind one iota. This MAGA movement is the biggest movement to hit this country ever.” Ayres, the GOP pollster, said Republican voters in this race have viewed Trump more as an incumbent seeking another term than most strategists expected. Ayres joked that the only way to understand the solidity of Trump’s support now would be to examine “the exit polls from 1892” when Democrats renominated Grover Cleveland, who had won the presidency in 1884 and then lost it in 1888 to Republican Benjamin Harrison. (There were no exit polls, needless to say, in the 19th century.) “That’s the analogy: a former president running again to defeat the guy who beat him,” Ayres said. Reed, the former Dole campaign manager, ran a super PAC that supported former Vice President Mike Pence in the 2024 race. Pence, Reed recalled, delivered “thoughtful … forward-looking speeches” on the issues that conservative voters in the GOP base say are their priorities: “economic growth, entitlement reform, life, Ukraine, Israel, the border, inflation, education – most of them in Iowa and New Hampshire.” But the result was that “no one seemed to care,” Reed said. Pence dropped out of the race in October – a fate that came for DeSantis on Sunday. “We came to the conclusion that nothing matters until this Trump fever passes,” Reed said. “He’s got this fever grip on Republicans, and we’ll see if he is going to beat Biden this time.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/fact-check-trump-invade-iraq/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump repeated a variety of his previous false claims about the Middle East, rival Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other subjects in an interview that aired Sunday morning on Fox News – notably including his years-old lie that he warned the US not to invade Iraq. Here’s a non-comprehensive roundup. Invasion of Iraq Trump revived a lie he has been uttering since his 2016 presidential campaign – an assertion that he publicly spoke out against the idea of invading Iraq. He said on Fox: “Going into Iraq was a stupid thing. Remember I used to say: ‘Don’t do it, but if you do it, keep the oil.’” Facts First: Trump’s claim that he said “Don’t do it” is false ; the claim was debunked eight years ago . In reality, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq before it occurred . In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” Trump argued a military strike on Iraq might be necessary; when radio host Howard Stern asked Trump in September 2002 whether he is “for invading Iraq,” Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly”; and Trump did not express a firm opinion about the looming war in a Fox interview in January 2003 , saying that “either you attack or don’t attack” and that then-President George W. Bush “has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps.” Trump began criticizing the war in 2003, but after the invasion, and also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq. He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004. You can read more here about his shifting positions. A CNN search in 2019 turned up no examples of Trump saying anything before the war about keeping Iraq’s oil. Trump’s White House did not respond at the time to our request to provide any such evidence. Iran’s missiles Trump repeated a claim he has made at various campaign events in recent months , saying Iran intentionally avoided hitting a base that housed US troops in Iraq when it launched missiles toward the base in January 2020 in retaliation for the Trump-ordered assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani . Trump claimed on Fox, as he has before, that Iran “called me” to let him know of its plan to deliberately miss. He said, “We knew they weren’t going to hit inside the fort” even though outside observers were left wondering, “How come they all missed?” Facts First : Trump’s claims that all of Iran’s missiles missed the base are false. As The Washington Post noted in its own fact check late last year, 11 Iranian missiles hit the al-Asad base Iran targeted in the retaliatory attack. The fact that missiles hit the base was confirmed by satellite images , by the Pentagon , and by a CNN visit to the base days after the attack. CNN reported from the scene: “Ten of the 11 missiles struck US positions at the sprawling desert Iraqi airbase. One struck a remote location on the Iraqi military’s side.” CNN reported that “the Iranian missiles, which used on-board guidance systems, managed to shred sensitive US military sites, damaging a special forces compound, and two hangars, in addition to the US drone operators’ housing unit.” While no US troops were killed, more than 100 were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries. Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, told reporters he believed Iran’s intent was to kill; he credited “the defensive techniques that our forces used” for the absence of deaths. Trump has provided no substantiation for the claim that Iran called him to telegraph the strike and offer reassurance. As The Post reported, Iraq’s prime minister said he received a general warning from Iran that it was about to begin its response and target US troops. New Hampshire primary Trump said the New Hampshire primary he won in January was the one place that Haley had a chance to win – claiming that this is “because Democrats are stupidly allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and independents also.” Facts First : Trump’s claim is false . Registered Democrats aren’t allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republicans and independents are allowed to vote . Some independents who lean toward Democrats almost certainly participated in the Republican primary, plus some Democrats who switched their affiliation to independent before the early October deadline. But Trump claimed, with no caveats, that Democrats are simply allowed to vote in New Hampshire. That’s not true. (And it is standard for states to allow people to switch affiliations by a certain date to participate in another party’s primary.) Indiana primary ballot Trump claimed of Haley: “We have a situation where they forgot to apply, I guess, for Indiana. You don’t run and not apply for Indiana. Great state.” Facts First : This is false. Haley did not forget to apply to be on the Republican primary ballot in Indiana. The filing deadline for the May 7 primary, February 9, has not arrived yet. Trump has previously made a different claim that Haley did not submit enough signatures by the state’s January 30 signature deadline to qualify for the ballot; Haley’s campaign told CNN and other media outlets that this is not true and that she submitted more than enough signatures. Regardless, the campaign didn’t forget to apply. “We’ll be on the ballot. We turned in more than double all the signatures required and they are being verified now as part of the process before the filing deadline on February 9,” Haley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a Sunday email. In response to a similar claim from Trump, Haley wrote on social media on Friday: “Looks like he’s confused again…” Mitch McConnell and the Green New Deal In a clip from the interview that Fox aired Friday, Trump claimed McConnell has supported trillions in spending on “projects that are Green New Deal.” The Green New Deal is a broad congressional resolution , supported by some Democratic legislators, that calls for major investments in a wide variety of environmental, social and economic initiatives . “Mitch McConnell: I mean, he’s agreed billions of dollars and trillions of dollars for projects that are Green New Deal – you know, I call it the Green New Scam – trillions of dollars for the Green New Scam,” Trump said . Facts First : Trump’s claim that McConnell has supported “trillions” in spending on Green New Deal projects is false even under a generous-to-Trump definition of what counts as a Green New Deal project. And as in the past , Trump failed to mention here that McConnell has been a vocal opponent of the Green New Deal congressional resolution as  a whole – and that Congress has never actually passed the resolution. McConnell has repeatedly denounced the Green New Deal resolution, describing it as, among other things, “radical,” “socialist” and a “mess.” So what is Trump talking about? Trump’s similar past attacks have been about how McConnell voted in 2021 for a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that contained spending that overlaps with some of the proposals in the wide-ranging Green New Deal resolution. For example, the 2021 infrastructure bill contained tens of billions in spending on cleaning up toxic waste sites, modernizing public transportation, increasing the country’s resilience against climate change, ensuring drinking water is clean, and facilitating a transition to zero- and low-emissions vehicles. But even if you were to count all of this as “Green New Deal” spending – which would be misleading given that the list includes priorities that both parties funded long before the Green New Deal was introduced in 2019 – the total would be in the hundreds of billions, not “trillions.” McConnell opposed a major Democratic bill in 2022 that spent hundreds of billions more on climate initiatives. Border wall Touting his performance on immigration policy, Trump claimed, as he has before, “I built 561 miles of wall.” Facts First : Trump’s “561 miles” claim is false, a substantial exaggeration. An official report by US Customs and Border Protection , written two days after Trump left office and subsequently obtained by CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said the number built under Trump was 458 miles (including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers). Even in his campaign speeches late last year, Trump sometimes put the figure, more correctly, at “nearly 500 miles.” You can read more here . CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-new-hampshire-victory-speech/index.html,"CNN — Former President Donald Trump made several false claims in a speech Tuesday night after CNN and other media outlets projected that he would win the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire. CNN also watched rival candidate Nikki Haley’s Tuesday night speech in New Hampshire; Haley’s claims were either accurate or too general to fact check. Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s assertions. The 2020 election Trump repeated some of his familiar lies about the 2020 presidential election. At one point, he claimed, as he has repeatedly in the past, that “they used Covid to cheat.” At another point, he claimed that in addition to winning in 2016, “we also won in 2020 – by more. And we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.” He dismissively said, “But as they said, we lost by a whisker.” Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. He lost the 2020 election fair and square to Joe Biden, by a 306 to 232 margin in the Electoral College, and also lost New Hampshire in that election. There remains no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state. Democrats and taxes Trump Tuesday night said, “Do they hate our country? They must hate our country. Because there’s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look – the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four.” Facts First: This is false. Neither Biden nor other top Democrats are proposing anything close to quadrupling people’s taxes. CNN previously fact-checked a similar Trump claim that “they want to double, triple everything.” Howard Gleckman , senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, said in a November email: “I don’t know what ‘they want to double, triple everything’ means. But if he’s suggesting that Biden would ‘double, triple’ federal income taxes, he’s just making up numbers. There is no evidence to support that claim.” Gleckman said his organization’s analysis of Biden’s budget proposal for fiscal 2024, which included his most recent tax plan, found that the major tax provisions would “would raise taxes by an average of $2,290, or reduce taxable income by 2.3 percent.” General elections in New Hampshire Trump claimed that he has always won the state – not only in Republican primaries but in general elections. “You know we won New Hampshire three times now three. We win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We won it and it’s a very, very special place to me.” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He lost New Hampshire to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election and to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 general election , though he did win the Republican primary each time. Primary voters Criticizing Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a supporter of Haley, Trump said that because of Sununu’s incompetence, “in the Republican primary, they accepted Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats – Democrats before October 6 – they already voted. Now, they’re only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible.” Facts First: Trump’s claims are misleading at best. People registered as Democrats were not allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republicans and independents (people registered as “undeclared”) were allowed to cast ballots in that primary . While it’s true that nearly 4,000 people who had been registered as Democrats switched their affiliation to either undeclared or Republican by October 6, the last day to switch in time to potentially cast a ballot in the GOP primary, it’s not yet clear how many of these people actually ended up voting. And it’s important to note that New Hampshire made its primaries open to independents decades before Sununu became governor in 2017. Also, while Trump was complaining about people formerly registered as Democrats being permitted to vote in the Republican primary, it is standard for states to allow people to switch affiliations by a certain date in order to participate in another party’s primary – and some states have switching deadlines closer to an election day than New Hampshire does. In Trump’s state of Florida, to name one , voters can switch from Democratic to Republican by February 20 and cast a ballot in the Republican primary in the early voting window that begins less than three weeks later or in person a month later on the March 19 election day. (Unlike in New Hampshire, independents can’t cast Republican primary ballots there.) Finally, the motivations of the recent New Hampshire affiliation-switchers are not nearly as clear as Trump suggested. While some might have indeed switched with the sole intention of opposing him, some others might have sincerely decided that they no longer saw themselves as Democrats. There was all kinds of affiliation-switching before October 6. For example, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported that 719 people switched from Republican to undeclared and 132 people switched from undeclared to Republican."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-abortion-ban-no-exceptions/index.html,"CNN — North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the state’s second highest-ranking elected official and its leading Republican candidate for governor in 2024, once hailed banning abortion as his top priority, advocating for its complete ban without exceptions. “For me, there is no compromise on abortion. It makes no difference to me why or how that child ended up in that womb,” he said in July 2020 while campaigning for lieutenant governor. At the time, Robinson was a political newcomer, having built his campaign off his work as a conservative influencer espousing support for gun rights, law enforcement and “protecting the life of the unborn.” Now, as the 2024 GOP front-runner for governor, Robinson avoids mentioning abortion on the campaign trail, claiming recently that he stopped using what he calls the “a-word,” preferring instead to use the word “life.” He’s also softened his position. Robinson denies ever supporting abortion bans without exceptions, publicly stating that he has always struggled with the issue and confirming that he once paid for an abortion for his then-girlfriend, now-wife in the 1980s, an experience he says he fully regrets. But in comments reviewed by CNN’s KFile dating back to 2018, Robinson regularly labeled abortion as “murder” and “ genocide ,” comparing the anti-abortion movement to the abolitionist movement to end slavery. He also baselessly speculated that the founders of Planned Parenthood were satanists who practiced witchcraft. Robinson characterized women who undergo abortions, even if they are just “24 hours pregnant,” as murderers. Robinson’s current position, his office has said, is support for so-called “heartbeat” legislation, which could ban abortion after a “heartbeat” is detected — but with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. If victorious in this year’s election, Robinson would be the first Black governor in the state’s history. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson speaks during a press conference in Raleigh on Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Ethan Hyman/The News & Observer/Tribune News Service/Getty Images Rhetorical shift post-Dobbs Robinson’s rhetorical shift has come since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 Dobbs decision to overturn the right to an abortion established in Roe v. Wade, and as North Carolina passed its own controversial 12-week abortion ban last May, with Republican lawmakers overriding the Democratic governor’s veto. The North Carolina law went into effect in July and restricts abortion access from the previous limit of 20 weeks down to 12 weeks, limits medication abortion to 10 weeks, and requires patients to meet in-person with a physician at least 72 hours before the procedure. It does have exceptions for cases of rape and incest through 20 weeks and “life-limiting” fetal anomalies through 24 weeks. As state Republicans finalized their abortion bill last year, Robinson declined to comment on the legislation at the time. “I’m tired of talking about abortion. I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” he said in May 2023, according to WFAE. In July, Rolling Stone reported on audio of Robinson saying he tries not to use the word abortion anymore. “North Carolina needs to become a destination state for life. Now notice what I said: I said ‘life.’ I did not say the a-word. The a-word. Everybody wants us to say the a-word,” he said. Robinson is no stranger to controversy. As CNN’s KFile previously reported, he mocked and attacked the Parkland school shooting survivors. The Greensboro native also attacked the Civil Rights movement, lamenting that “so many freedoms were lost,” and criticized the historic Woolworth lunch counter sit-in protests in 1960 that originated in his hometown. As the 2024 election nears, abortion remains a driving factor in the gubernatorial race. Democrats in the state, and the campaign of the Democratic front-runner for governor, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, have often pointed to comments Robinson made in February in which he talked about the political realities of abortion bans. “If I had all the power right now, let’s say I was the governor and had a willing legislature, we could pass a bill saying you can’t have an abortion in North Carolina for any reason,” he said in a February 2023 radio interview. “Would that stop abortions? No. People would get in their car, they’d go to Georgia, they’d go to South Carolina. They would go to Virginia, they’d go wherever they could. They’d get pills online . Passing a law is one thing, I’d love to pass a law. I’d love to see a ‘heartbeat bill’ proposed in our legislature.” At a public event in August , Robinson said he didn’t recall making statements in support of a total ban on abortion and said that he always struggled on the issue. And on a podcast in April, Robinson expressed a commitment to not governing based on his “personal religious belief.” He stressed the importance of reaching a consensus on anti-abortion legislation. “I would love to see abortion outlawed, make no qualms about that. I don’t believe in abortion under any circumstances,” Robinson said. “Being an elected official, I don’t rule by my opinion, and I don’t rule by just what I think.” Michael Lonergan, a spokesperson for the Robinson campaign, told CNN, “Lt. Gov Robinson has publicly supported legislation that would limit abortion after a heartbeat is detected, with protections for extreme situations such as rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger.” ‘Truly from the pit of hell’ Given Robinson’s rhetorical shift on abortion, his previous statements on the topic look particularly harsh. In January 2019, as New York was passing a law allowing abortion past 24 weeks in cases where a woman’s life was at risk or the fetus was non-viable, Robinson took to Facebook , condemning abortion as “child sacrifice.” Specifically targeting then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, he went as far as to describe Cuomo’s beliefs as being “truly from the pit of hell” and said, “Satan must be his muse.” That sort of rhetoric was typical for Robinson, who first saw his breakout in politics in 2018 after a speech he gave in support of gun rights went viral following the Parkland school shooting. The video launched a career as a conservative media personality for Robinson, who previously served in the Army Reserve and worked in furniture manufacturing.

The Conservative Political Action Conference launched in 1974 brings together conservative organizations, elected leaders, and activists. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images Republican front-runner for North Carolina governor attacked Civil Rights Movement: ‘So many freedoms were lost’ In speeches and interviews that followed as his star rose, Robinson was frank about his views on abortion. “I’m convinced that Margaret Sanger and all of her contemporaries that followed her, they were witches, all of ‘em,” Robinson said of the founder of the American birth control movement on a podcast. “They were witches. I have no doubt. It would not shock me one bit if they were not satanists involved in witchcraft.” “Who else would come up with the solution, that the only solution to keep people from having unwanted pregnancies is to kill the unborn,” he added. “It’s an idea straight from the devil.” Running for lieutenant governor in 2020, Robinson did not shy away from his belief. That year, he responded to a survey from American Family Association Action, a socially conservative group, and said abortion should not be allowed under any circumstances . When asked at a “Life Wins” event in September 2020 if there were any circumstances in which abortion would be OK, Robinson responded, “I do not believe so.” “When it came to slavery, we had to end slavery for the cause of liberty,” he added. “And we have to end abortion for the cause of life.” In a speech at an anti-abortion event in January 2021, Robinson called abortion providers the “butchers of humanity,” and condemned abortion as murder. “A lot of people tell me, ‘Don’t say abortion is murder,’” he said. “Guess what? Abortion is murder.” In a July 2021 speech to a church, Robinson labeled women who receive abortions murderers as well. “You know, I ain’t supposed to say this, but I’m going to say it,” he said. “I don’t care whether you just got pregnant. I don’t care if you’re 24 hours pregnant. I don’t care if you’re 24 weeks pregnant. I don’t care. If you kill that young’un. It is murder. You got blood on your hands.” Admitting a past abortion Despite this rhetoric, in early 2022 CNN affiliate WRAL uncovered a Facebook post from 2012 in which Robinson said he paid for an abortion in 1989. He later confirmed that the abortion was for his then-girlfriend and now-wife, Yolanda Hill Robinson, in a Facebook video in March 2022 . “Before we were married and before we had kids, we had an abortion. It was the hardest decision we have ever made, and sadly, we made the wrong one,” he said, addressing the camera in the Facebook video. “This decision has been with us ever since. It’s because of this experience and our spiritual journey that we are so adamantly pro-life,” he said. A week after Roe was overturned in June 2022, Robinson expressed his goals to make sure North Carolina had the strictest abortion laws in the country. “Now abortion, you all know how I feel about abortion,” Robinson said in a speech posted on Facebook.” “I want North Carolina to be the most pro-life state in the nation. Hands down. Abortion is murder. It’s a scourge on this nation. It needs to go.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/south-carolina-democratic-primary-biden/index.html,"CNN — South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago , will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects. In a result that was largely expected, Biden will defeat his two nearest challengers, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson, as he claims his first delegates in his quest to win his party’s nomination again. Biden won all 55 delegates at stake in the South Carolina primary. This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging . Biden, who was in Los Angeles for a fundraising event Saturday evening when his win was projected, said in a statement that South Carolina put him on a path toward victory. “In 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the Presidency,” he said. “Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again — and making Donald Trump a loser — again.” DNC elevates South Carolina over Iowa and New Hampshire For decades, Iowa and New Hampshire had cast the first votes in Democratic presidential primary battles. But the Democratic National Committee decided to move those states back in the calendar in the face of criticism that their largely White electorates didn’t reflect a Democratic base that is much more diverse nationally. Iowa Democratic officials accepted the changes, opting to hold a mail-in caucus with ballots sent to voters starting January 12 and due to be postmarked back by March 5 — Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen other states are scheduled to hold their primaries. New Hampshire officials, citing a state law requiring that its primary be the nation’s first, pushed back — holding a rogue Democratic contest alongside the Republican primary on January 23. However, the Democratic National Committee punished the Granite State by stripping it of delegates to the party’s 2024 convention. Because the state did not comply with the calendar the DNC had set, Biden didn’t file to appear on the state’s primary ballot. But loyalists of the president launched a successful write-in campaign on his behalf that saw him take 64% of the vote . The state that propelled Biden’s 2020 win To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday. “You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend. The president wasn’t in South Carolina on Saturday, as he headed for a fundraising swing through Southern California and Nevada. Before his departure, he made a stop at his reelection campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, giving brief remarks with an eye toward the general election. “This is not just a campaign. This is more of a mission. We cannot, we cannot, we cannot lose this campaign, for the good of the country,” Biden said. “I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It’s not about me,” he said. “It’s about the country. And I think everybody knows it and I think it’s beginning to dawn on people.” “The American people get it. They understand what’s going on,” Biden said, framing the contest around the protection of democracy. Attendees cheer as Biden speaks at a South Carolina Democratic Party event in Columbia on January 27, 2024. Kent Nishimura/AFP/Getty Images With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020. Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival. Days later, Biden moved closer to clinching the party’s nomination by racking up a virtually insurmountable delegate lead across a wide swath of diverse states on Super Tuesday. South Carolina is dominated by Republicans in general elections. The last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state was Jimmy Carter in 1976. But the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Democratic primary took place three weeks before Republicans will vote on February 24. The GOP primary could be former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ’s last chance to slow former President Donald Trump ’s march to a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination. But a recent Monmouth University-Washington Post poll showed her trailing Trump by 26 points in her home-state primary. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/mike-johnson-congress-bill-israel-aid-house/index.html,"CNN — The House will vote next week on a standalone bill providing aid for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced in a letter Saturday, representing an about-face for the speaker as the Senate prepares to unveil its own long-awaited border deal and foreign aid package . Johnson put a $14.3 billion Israel aid package on the floor last year that included partisan IRS funding cuts that Democrats opposed. Now, the Louisiana Republican is planning to move a $17.6 billion Israel bill with no offsets, upping pressure on Democrats to support it. In his “Dear Colleague” letter to lawmakers, Johnson attacked senators for excluding him and the House from bipartisan negotiations over a border security deal, which is expected to be paired with aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. “While the Senate appears poised to finally release text of their supplemental package after months of behind closed doors negotiations, their leadership is aware that by failing to include the House in their negotiations, they have eliminated the ability for swift consideration of any legislation,” Johnson wrote. “As I have said consistently for the past three months, the House will have to work its will on these issues and our priorities will need to be addressed.” Johnson called on the Senate to take up the standalone Israel bill swiftly, ratcheting up pressure on senators to abandon their efforts to keep Israel aid linked with other issues. “During debate in the House and in numerous subsequent statements, Democrats made clear that their primary objection to the original House bill was with its offsets,” Johnson wrote. “The Senate will no longer have excuses, however misguided, against swift passage of this critical support for our ally.” The White House on Saturday blasted the move, which would upend the Biden administration’s efforts to pass a national security supplemental funding package that includes additional funding for Ukraine and the US-Mexico border, as Republicans’ “latest cynical maneuver.” “The security of Israel should be sacred, not a political game,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. “We strongly oppose this ploy which does nothing to secure the border, does nothing to help the people of Ukraine defend themselves against Putin’s aggression, and denies humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians.” Senate negotiators are expected to unveil bill text for a border deal and supplemental funding package no later than Sunday, with procedural votes starting next week. But its prospects for passage remain in doubt, given the opposition from former President Donald Trump and the House GOP. This story has been updated with additional developments.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/black-voters-biden-south-carolina/index.html,"Charleston CNN — Running a small business has been a “special experience” for Mimi Striplin, the 31-year-old owner of The Tiny Tassel in Charleston. Striplin started her jewelry company nine years ago and opened her first brick-and-mortar storefront in 2021, where she also sells whimsical clothing designed by her mother and goods made by other Black women-owned businesses. Her local community has helped uplift her business, she said, but she’s also experienced the hard times that come with entrepreneurship, especially now. When she was invited to meet with President Joe Biden a few weeks ago as part of a small business roundtable ahead of the state’s February 3 primary, she had a simple message for him: See us. “I wanted him to think about faces like mine when he is speaking on policies and really moving things,” Striplin, who is also Asian American, told CNN. To win reelection this year, Biden will need Black voters like Striplin – who voted for him in the last presidential election and plan to support him again – to rebuild the coalition that helped propel him to the White House in 2020. South Carolina’s primary will be the first opportunity Black voters have to voice their support – or displeasure – with Biden since that election. “I think we’ll get a real chance to see where Joe Biden is, and also get a real chance to see what messages have resonated from the Biden-Harris administration,” said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist and close ally of Rep. Jim Clyburn. It’s a challenging path. Biden’s net approval rating has been negative for more than two years. Polls have shown former President Donald Trump beating Biden in key swing states in a hypothetical rematch. And there are signs that Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is making small gains in some key parts of the Democratic coalition, including among Black voters. Democrats’ efforts to stem those losses start in South Carolina, which is hosting the first sanctioned primary after the Democratic National Committee overhauled its primary calendar last year to put more diverse states first, a move party members say has given Black voters an early and important voice. The calendar overhaul, done at Biden’s request, was also seen as a boost to the president, who placed poorly in the 2020 Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary before winning by a decisive margin in South Carolina, in large part due to his strong support among Black voters. In 2020, Biden won 61% of the Black vote, which made up 56% of the Democratic primary electorate, according to CNN exit polling . Biden and several surrogates have held campaign events across the state. Last weekend, Biden campaigned at a church in Columbia with Clyburn , whose endorsement during the 2020 primary helped seal his victory in the state. The event was interrupted by protesters calling on the president to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris also spoke at a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday, the last day of early voting. “South Carolina, you are the first primary in the nation, and President Biden and I are counting on you,” Harris said. “Are you ready to make your voices heard?” For South Carolina Democrats, being the first sanctioned primary isn’t just about putting Biden on the right footing, but a chance to draw attention to local topics after years of watching candidates cater to the problems facing Iowa and New Hampshire voters. “So what does going first mean? It means more investment in our communities, more attention to our issues,” Christale Spain, the chair of the state Democratic Party, said at a “We Go First” get-out-the-vote event in Walterboro this week. Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former chair of the state Democratic Party, said South Carolina’s new first-in-the-nation status would increase discussion on investment in historically Black colleges and universities, lowering the Black infant mortality rate and the need to tackle racial disparities. The new calendar also reflects the fact that the state has a good record of picking the eventual nominee, he said. The winners of the last three primaries – Biden, Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama – went on to be the Democratic nominees. “We made the change because we wanted to make sure that all of the Democrats had a seat at the table,” Harrison said at a recent get out the vote event during an interview with CNN in Hartsville. “We know that the backbone of the Democratic Party has been the African American community.” Attendees cheer as President Joe Biden speaks during the South Carolina's First in the Nation Dinner at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina, on January 27. Kent Nishimura/AFP/Getty Images It will be difficult to judge what success looks like on Saturday. Though Biden is being challenged by Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson, the president is likely to win handily in what’s expected to be a low turnout primary. But Biden and his allies are still encouraging Democrats to cast ballots in a show of enthusiasm for the president. Some are heeding the call. Juanita Hamilton drove nearly two hours from Hilton Head to an event in Summerville this week to help draw attention to early voting, which began January 22, and the importance of the upcoming  election. Hamilton said her admiration and respect for Biden has only grown since she voted for him in 2020 and she wanted to stand for him the way she felt he’d stood for her and others. “I’m trying to do a small part,” she said. “If I can be seen by a few young people who are voting for the first time – if they aren’t sure, let me say, ‘Auntie Juanita says come on out and vote.’” On Saturday afternoon, the state Democratic Party touted increased Black voter turnout in early and absentee voting, saying more than 76% of such ballots cast in the 2024 primary came from Black voters, 13% more than in 2020. Of the 51,710 early votes cast, including absentee ballots, more than 6,100 came from voters who had never cast a ballot in a Democratic primary, South Carolina Democratic Party Executive Director Jay Parmley added. “Before the polls close, and I can say this without any doubt … this primary has been a success,” said Lindsey Green, the state party’s get-out-the-vote director. “This primary is really the latest signal from our president and our national party that Democrats are not just parachuting in at the very last minute to ask for voters from communities of color.” At another get-out-the-vote event in Charleston, at the famous Hannibal’s Kitchen soul food restaurant, George McCray of Eutawville said he supports Biden because he believes he’s a fair person at his core. He didn’t think Obama would have made Biden his vice president if he wasn’t, he said. “He thinks before he acts,” McCray said. “He talks to his people and he makes the proper decisions. That’s a person that should stay a president for eight years.” But Gabriel Fant, a 38-year-old personal trainer and server at Hannibal’s, said she deeply regrets her decision to vote for Biden in 2020. She won’t be voting in the primary and is still deciding what she’ll do in the general election. “I’m telling Black people: Stay home,” she said. Fant criticized the argument that Black Americans need to cast a ballot to honor the sacrifices made to secure the right to vote. Withholding her vote would also send a message, she said. “People say our ancestors died for us to vote, like they sell us that, but it’s really our ancestors made this available as a tool for us to be liberated and move forward,” she said. “So it’s political when you do and it’s political when you don’t.” The seventh-generation Charleston native said she felt none of the candidates running for president were laying out a clear plan to create a solid economic floor for Black Americans. And she was tired of hearing Biden surrogates tell her about how much he has done for her community. “If I feel it, you don’t have to tell me,” she said. “I should feel it in my pocket, I should feel it at the gas pump, I should feel that at the grocery store. Everywhere.” Fant’s more pessimistic view of the economy is common. Just 35% of Americans said they think the economy is doing well or very well, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Friday . That’s a slight improvement from the 28% of Americans who said the same in the November version of the poll, but well below how people felt before the pandemic. The poll released Friday found that 26% of Americans feel the economy is starting to recover while 48% believe conditions are still deteriorating. There are some clear indications that the economy has improved since Biden took office. Black unemployment reached a record low of 4.7% in April 2023 and real wages – earnings adjusted for inflation – have risen. Between 2019 and 2022, the last two years of the Trump administration and the first two years of the Biden administration, real wage growth grew the most for workers in the bottom 10th-percentile, according to a March 2023 report from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. Job growth has also been strong. The US added 353,000 jobs last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , far surpassing the forecasts from economists. The unemployment rate was 3.7%, marking 24 consecutive months it has been below 4%. Valerie Wilson, the director of the Economic Policy Institute’s Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy, said part of voters’ dissatisfaction with the economy may come from sticker shock over high prices. But those feelings, particularly in the Black community, may also be a response to long-standing racial disparities. “Inequality isn’t a new thing, it hasn’t gone away,” Wilson said. Striplin, of The Tiny Tassel, said she’d seen direct and indirect benefits from Biden’s policies and described him as the best options Democrats have right now. She worried about the alternative, another Trump administration, and said there were days when she feared for her safety when the former president was last in office. Not voting wasn’t an option for her. “That’s the most passive way that we can show up in life,” Striplin said. “And for me personally, and our team here, we don’t live in that space of being passive.” Mimi Striplin, founder of The Tiny Tassel in Charleston, South Carolina, speaks with CNN's Eva McKend.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/president-biden-super-bowl-interview/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden will skip a pre-Super Bowl interview for the second year in a row — and his aides argue that it’s part of their larger plan, not a move to avoid having the president answer questions in front of the whole country. Biden advisers tell CNN they see skipping the interview, which would have aired as a segment of the pregame show and not during peak viewing hours on the CBS broadcast, as a strategic decision to give Americans a break from the politics of the 2024 campaign. Advisers say they’re seeing people already expressing fatigue with election news and want to avoid piling on. The decision was made ahead of last week’s right-wing media explosion about Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, after he and the Kansas City Chiefs made it to the Super Bowl, where they’ll face the San Francisco 49ers. MAGA media personalities have been circulating conspiracy theories about the pop superstar, promoting the notion that she is part of a sprawling psychological operations plot staged by the NFL and Democratic Party to deliver the 2024 presidential election to Biden. The pregame presidential interview is a relatively young tradition, stretching back only to Barack Obama’s first year in office, and one that Donald Trump skipped once himself. But for Biden, who for months has been complaining in public and in conversations with top advisers that messaging touting his achievements isn’t breaking through to the public, the decision means skipping out on an audience of millions — including many who might not otherwise be paying attention to presidential politics. It’s also the latest instance of Biden opting against a high-profile interview with a large audience. That has become a constant source of irritation for the White House press corps, but has also fed questions of whether he is up to doing them. In response, Biden advisers often point to the many times each week the president takes questions from reporters as he is headed across the White House South Lawn to board Marine One, or interviews like those he did on local radio this past week ahead of Saturday’s South Carolina Democratic primary . Biden advisers say that there are no concerns about insulating the president, and that it wasn’t part of the decision on this interview. On Saturday, Biden argued there is more than regular politics to the 2024 race, saying in remarks at his Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters, “This is not just a campaign. This is more of a mission. We cannot, we cannot, we cannot lose this campaign, for the good of the country.” “I think everybody knows it and I think it’s beginning to dawn on people,” Biden added. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other top Democrats have argued the president’s consistently low poll numbers are largely the result of Americans not knowing enough about him and his record, and that they have to do more to break through. Not next Sunday, though. “We hope viewers enjoy watching what they tuned in for — the game,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt told CNN. Biden did sit for a Super Bowl interview shortly after taking office in 2021, and the campaign didn’t start this season viewing football as sacrosanct time. A Biden ad touting his success at improving the economy was placed on local stations and national cable during the season opener between the Chiefs and Detroit Lions in September, and more were run for the Lions-Green Bay Packers game on Thanksgiving. The campaign argued at the time that it was a chance to appeal to big audiences in those two swing states. In past years, the Super Bowl presidential interviews often drove news coverage for days. But the Biden White House has always been skeptical of the value of doing so, in part due to anxiety that a flub could become an unwanted distraction. Biden’s last major interview was on comedian Conan O’Brien’s podcast, recorded at the White House in December."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/merrick-garland-resumes-duties-back-procedure/index.html,"CNN — Attorney General Merrick Garland has resumed his official duties after undergoing a “minimally invasive back procedure” Saturday, according to a Department of Justice spokesperson. “The Attorney General’s procedure went well and he’s recovering at home. He has resumed his duties,” Xochitl Hinojosa, director of public affairs for the DOJ, wrote in an email. The DOJ announced ahead of the procedure that, while Garland would be under anesthesia for “about 90 minutes,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco would assume his duties “shortly before the procedure, during the procedure, and for a brief period following the procedure to allow for recovery from general anesthesia.” This comes after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s recent hospitalization was not disclosed to the media or to President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials for days. The defense secretary returned to work at the Pentagon on Monday. He was admitted to the hospital on New Year’s Day due to complications from surgery to treat prostate cancer in late December. Austin’s unannounced hospitalization raised major questions about transparency and communication within the Biden administration. The White House last month issued new guidelines for agency notification of key absences following its review of each federal agency’s plans for “delegation of authority” when a Cabinet member is unable to perform his or her duties. Additionally, Austin’s chief of staff directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. The Defense Department inspector general also launched a separate investigation into whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in place to ensure an effective transfer of power and duties.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/rnc-meeting-trump-nominee/index.html,"Las Vegas CNN — The consensus at the 2024 Republican National Committee winter meeting in Las Vegas this week was clear among the pro-Trump and anti-Trump factions alike: Donald Trump will be the party’s presidential nominee this year. “Let’s be honest about it. Trump is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party unless something drastic happens over the next few months,” said Alabama Republican Party chairman John Wahl. “And so with that in mind, yes, obviously the Democrats are already looking toward the general election. They’ve already started campaigning against Donald Trump. Republicans are ready to get there as well.” The confidence among the body of 168 RNC committee members reflected the former president’s dominance and enduring grip over much of the GOP.  Most members in attendance either said they are Trump supporters or pledged to support the party’s eventual nominee. Few, if any, publicly voiced support for Trump’s last remaining rival, Nikki Haley. “I would say not only that he’s going to be the nominee, but the RNC is at least if not more pro-Trump than the average Republican,” said Rob Steele, an RNC committee member from Michigan. Steele estimated that the 168-member body is now made up of 70% of people who became chairs and joined the committee since Trump was first nominated in 2016. Even as Trump nears the finish line of the Republican primary after neatly sweeping up victories in Iowa and New Hampshire last month, he is still facing four criminal indictments and is fighting a jury verdict in a civil defamation case. And Haley has vowed to stay in the race through her home state of South Carolina and beyond. But members voiced confidence in how the primary would play out and what needed to come after as they also voiced a sense of urgency for the primary to wrap itself up even if it were just nominally. The race between Trump and Haley will come to a head in South Carolina on February 24. Haley and her team have sought to close Trump’s lead in the state by highlighting her record as governor and reminding voters of her roots in the state, and she has sought to downplay the potential results in the state. But though South Carolina is Haley’s home state where she was elected twice to the top office, Trump has polled ahead of her there. He also has been endorsed by several politicians from the state, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, Gov. Henry McMaster, and Rep. Nancy Mace. Trump and his team have also made a point of scheduling fundraisers there to undercut what momentum Haley has had among deep pocketed donors. At the winter meeting, Republican committee members and chairs again and again voiced an eagerness for the South Carolina primary to happen and an indisputable nominee to emerge. “I think the process plays out how it’s going to play out but I think it’s coming to a conclusion sooner rather than later,” Florida Republican Party chairman Evan Power said in an interview. “I think when you look at what will happen if Democrats win. They can control everything. They’ll eliminate filibuster. They’ll pack the Supreme Court. We need to unite and get involved in this firefight as soon as possible.” Former President Donald Trump takes the stage after defeating Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire primary election, during his watch party in Nashua, New Hampshire, on January 23. Doug Mills/The New York Times/Redux Related article Federal judge postpones trial in Trump’s DC election interference case The prospect of Trump clinching the 2024 Republican presidential nominee as he faces his criminal indictments has been looming over the party as the primary nears its end. Still, Shawn Steel, a RNC committee member from California, brushed off the danger of that scenario for the GOP ticket. Steel said Republicans should take comfort in the possibility that none of the major trials Trump faces will come up before the election. “There’s also the possibility of speculating that a meteorite shower would attack planet Earth and all of existence would go through a sixth major extinction …that would leave a mark no question about it,” Steel said. “But the good news is with all these possibilities, the legal consensus is none of these criminal trials are going to come up this year. That’s a fact of life. One civil trial might – one just did – and that doesn’t have the same force and effect.” That’s a sentiment that many RNC officials shared. “Unfortunately, the legal stuff is so out of line that it amounts to election interference,” Richard Porter, an RNC committee member from Illinois, said. “The cases are by and large ridiculous. So I don’t think people are persuaded by the merits of those cases. Still, other RNC committee members worry that the multiple court cases could distract from making the election about Biden’s record. “We would like the election to be a referendum on Biden’s failed presidency, but if we nominate Donald Trump, it will be about him rather than Biden,” Henry Barbour, a RNC committee member from Mississippi, said. Throughout the meeting, the target of open frustration about Republicans’ electoral woes or fundraising numbers has been directed away from Trump – to the frustration of some members. “The criticisms generally at (RNC chair Ronna McDaniel) are coming from Trumpers,” said Bill Palatucci, an RNC committee member from New Jersey who sometimes clashes with the more pro-Trump Republicans. “To me it’s pretty hypocritical and ironic that Ronna is taking criticisms.” Meeting highlights With the primary largely settled to committee members, concerns throughout the four-day meeting, instead, focused on other topics. RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has made a point lately of trying to direct the party to get a better handle on addressing abortion, following a string of losses for the party in the post-Roe world criticisms. The theme from the meeting was not to make any gamble on the upcoming presidential election. Some committee members were given fake RNC poker chips and cards that read “Don’t Gamble on the result…Carefully vetted Rules [sic] are the Safest bet.” At the RNC winter meeting, the chairwoman showed three attack ads from Democrats on abortion to preview what Republicans should expect over the next year on the issue. She reiterated the points she had made recently, including that supporting blanket abortion bans without exceptions would spell doom for candidates, according to a source familiar with McDaniel’s remarks. Candidates and Republican campaigns needed to work to define themselves early on abortion rather than let Democrats do that, she contended. The meeting also highlighted how the pro-Trump wing has created conflict within the party.  The ongoing dispute between disparate factions of the state Republican Party was on broad display this week as both Kristina Karamo, the ousted chair of the Michigan GOP, and her replacement, former Ambassador Pete Hoekstra, were both credentialed as guests. Neither were fully recognized as the official chair or could vote as other chairs. Critics among the RNC committee people also took aim at McDaniel’s handling of the organization’s budget and finances. That frustration came to a breaking point with a vote over a resolution that tried to add stipulations on what could go into the RNC budget – a move meant to handcuff the chair. That resolution failed decisively, according to a Republican in the room. Party leaders have become increasingly vocal in condemning conservative critics of the RNC and whether it is prepared for the toughest months of the 2024 election cycle. When Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo delivered a speech on Thursday, he made a point of saying he had no patience “with actors taking misleading shots at the RNC” and highlighted the “critical role the RNC played in his election,” according to a Republican that attended that speech. Lombardo, who flipped control of the Nevada governor’s mansion in 2022, emphasized in his speech the importance of matching a campaign’s message to the state or district that campaign is competing in, according to another Republican that attended his winter committee meeting speech. “He was basically saying everybody needs to quit complaining and beat Democrats,” a committee member who attended the speech said."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/biden-iran-balancing-act/index.html,"CNN — President Joe Biden ’s decision to strike 85 targets in Iraq and Syria on Friday in response to the death of three American soldiers last weekend amounted to a middle ground: short of a direct strike inside Iran, which would almost certainly spark a wider war, but still more expansive than any action the US has taken so far against the groups it accuses of destabilizing the region. There is little belief inside the American government that Biden’s actions will completely shut down the constellation of Iranian proxy groups that have been responsible for escalating attacks on American bases and commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea. A longer-term solution remains elusive, as Biden enters a reelection year while also pursuing a broad diplomatic breakthrough he hopes could transform the larger region. Whether the 125 precision-guided missiles fired over 30 minutes Friday night will have the effect of preventing further attacks on Americans is a question officials aren’t yet ready to answer. In this March 2022 photo, the Pentagon is seen from Air Force One as it flies over Washington, DC. Patrick Semansky/AP Related article US carries out retaliatory strikes on Iranian-linked militia targets in Iraq and Syria But there is hope that by taking out intelligence centers, weapons facilities, command and control operations and bunkers used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force and other affiliated militia groups, the US can diminish the militants’ capabilities and send a message that attacks won’t go unanswered. “I think it is a real strong deterrence,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and Iraq War veteran. “We’re saying: Listen, we don’t want to go to war. But have a little taste of what we can do. Here you go. Eighty-five targets. And I think that that is part of the balancing act that we need to be engaged in right now.” The American reprisal is not over, and officials have not ruled out unseen elements, like cyberattacks, to degrade Iran and its proxies’ capabilities. The White House said clearly ahead of the counterstrikes that it expected a multiphase response, with a trajectory and duration likely to be dictated by circumstances on the ground. How the coming days unfold will have wide ramifications for the region and for the president himself, who spent the hours before the American B-1 bombers began hitting their targets consoling grieving families of the three Americans killed in Jordan. It was only about an hour after Biden departed Dover Air Force Base in Delaware that the first US strikes began in Iraq and Syria. The timing was coincidental, officials said, but nonetheless symbolic of the gravity of his decision. “Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing,” Biden said in a written statement. “The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond.” Immediately after US officials in Washington received word that Tower 22 in Jordan was struck last weekend — ultimately resulting in the deaths of three American service members — Biden was presented with, and approved, a range of options on Sunday for retaliation, sources told CNN. And it was in a meeting with his top national security advisers the following morning in the Situation Room that Biden gave the specific green light for the first set of strikes in Iraq and Syria that was executed Friday. It was also in that meeting that the president was informed with the assessment that IRGC-backed militant groups were to blame for the Sunday drone attack, according to the sources. In selecting how to respond to the death of three Americans, Biden faced a consequential choice: how to retaliate, and send a message to Iran, while avoiding getting pulled into a wider regional war. Biden and his team assessed a set of options that each came with a certain degree of risk. Strike too hard, and what had been a relatively low-grade exchange of fire between the US and Iranian proxy groups could expand into something far more serious. Strike not hard enough, and a message of impunity could be interpreted by the group behind the deadly drone attack — and by Americans at home.

Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images Related article Analysis: What to make of the US retaliation strikes against pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria Adding another layer of complexity were the difficult negotiations ongoing to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and impose a prolonged pause in the fighting there, talks which officials said Biden was loathe to disrupt by potentially escalatory action. “It’s both a science and an art,” said former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who engaged in similar Situation Room debates during his tenure in Donald Trump’s administration. In developing options for the president, officials weighed the complexity of the attack, the estimated damage it would do, the number of Iranians or militia members it could kill, and the potential retaliation it might prompt. “That’s a discussion that goes on within the room: what will the impact be? What will we expect from the Iranians?” Esper said. “It’ll be important to see what happens when the sun comes up tomorrow morning in Iraq and Syria.” What Biden and his advisers agreed on was that the US response to the Americans’ deaths would have to be on a correspondingly different scale than the tit-for-tat exchange of fire that had been unfolding in the region since October 7. They were not short of options: plans have long been drawn up to go after targets associated with the array of Iranian-backed groups that have been fomenting instability in the region. Identifying a calibrated approach did not take long. Biden told reporters on Tuesday he’d made a decision on how to counter the drone attack — only two days after he vowed in South Carolina: “We shall respond.” Bad weather in the region played the biggest role in dictating when the strikes would occur, officials said afterward. Clear skies on Friday meant a lower risk of striking unintended targets — and preventing civilian casualties. The question that can only be answered in the coming days and weeks is whether the response will move the needle in Iran, who the US has accused of supplying and resourcing the militant groups behind the attack that killed the three Americans. These undated photos from the US Army Reserve Command show Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, 46, Spc. Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Spc. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. US Army Reserve Command American officials had already been detecting signs that leaders in Tehran were growing nervous about some of the actions of its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, according to multiple people familiar with US intelligence. And there are clear indications that Iran isn’t looking for a war with the United States — just as Washington insists it isn’t seeking a broader conflict. But how to resolve the problem of the militias is still not an easy one. There has been little evidence that American military action against them over the past several months — which the US frames as an effort at deterrence — has actually deterred anything. Biden acknowledged as much last month, saying that American strikes in Yemen on the Houthi rebel group haven’t stopped their attacks on the Red Sea shipping lane. Despite calls from Republicans in Washington to go directly after sites inside Iran, that option appeared unlikely from the start as the White House seeks to avoid becoming embroiled in a full-blown war. And there are few outward signs Washington is attempting to renew any diplomatic engagement with Tehran after Biden’s attempts earlier in his term to resuscitate the Obama-era nuclear deal stalled out. “There’s been no communications with Iran since the attack that killed our three soldiers in Jordan,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday night. That makes for a vanishingly narrow path for the president to navigate. “This is a very fine line. They are threading a needle here. And some of this is informed by history,” said Beth Sanner, a former senior intelligence official who was Trump’s intelligence briefer in the tense days surrounding his decision to strike a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani . “This is what every administration does,” Sanner said. “You are trying to figure out where that line is. … There isn’t a thing that you can point to that is the dot. You’re going to have to feel your way around it.” MJ Lee contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/us-strikes-iraq-syria/index.html,"CNN — The US conducted major airstrikes on 85 targets across seven locations in Iraq and Syria on Friday, the start of what will likely be a series of larger-scale US strikes on Iranian-backed militias who have carried out attacks on US troops in the Middle East. The retaliatory strikes – which lasted 30 minutes and were successful, according to the White House – came in response to a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on a US military outpost in Jordan on Sunday, which killed three US service members and wounded more than 40 others. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the US military response “will continue at times and places of our choosing.” “The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond,” Biden said. The strikes on Friday were markedly more significant than previous attacks on Iranian-backed militias over the last several weeks, which have primarily focused on weapons storage or training facilities. But the administration is threading a needle – they want to deter and stop further attacks but avoid a full-scale conflict with Iran breaking out in a region already roiled by the continuing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. US Central Command confirmed in a statement that airstrikes were carried out in Iraq and Syria “against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militia groups.” “US military forces struck more than 85 targets, with numerous aircraft to include long-range bombers flown from the United States. The airstrikes employed more than 125 precision munitions,” the statement said. “The facilities that were struck included command and control operations, centers, intelligence centers, rockets, and missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicle storages, and logistics and munition supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against US and Coalition forces,” the statement added. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the strikes are “the start of our response.” “(The US) launched a blatant air aggression against a number of sites and towns in the eastern region of Syria, and near the Syrian-Iraqi border, which led to the martyrdom of a number of civilians and soldiers, the injury of others, and the infliction of significant damage to public and private property,” the Syrian Ministry of Defense said in a statement . “We believe that the strikes were successful,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. Casualties The Syrian military on Saturday said the US strikes had killed civilians and soldiers and caused “significant damage” to infrastructure. CNN cannot independently verify the number or nature of the casualties. Syria’s state-run news agency SANA said the airstrikes had hit the areas of Deir Ezzor, Al-Bukamal, Al-Mayadeen, and their surroundings on the Syrian-Iraqi border. Iraq said the US strikes killed at least 16 people, including civilians, and injured 25 others. The attacks also targeted facilities used by Iranian-linked al Hashd al Shabi – or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) – in the Iraqi city of Al-Qaim, Iraqi officials said. The PMU is a predominantly Shiite Iran-backed paramilitary force based in Iraq. Unlike other Iran-backed groups around the region, the PMU is tied to the Iraqi government and is closely linked to Iran-aligned Shiite blocs that for years dominated politics in Iraq. Kirby had earlier said the US did not know now how many militants were killed or wounded. He added that US military aircraft was now out of harm’s way. Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that the locations of the strikes were chosen “with an idea that there would likely be casualties” among the IRGC and militia personnel who use them. The strikes took place soon after Biden attended a dignified transfer and met family members of the soldiers killed in Jordan. B-1 bombers – long-range heavy bombers that can deploy precision and non-precision weapons –were used in the operations, a defense official told CNN. Sims said Friday that the bombers flew in a “single non-stop flight” from the US, “all of that enhanced by our Transportation Command and our ability to gas and go along the way.” Sims also said that the timing of the strikes was designed around good weather, in “an interest of ensuring that we’re hitting all the right targets.” In this June 2023 photo from the US Air Force, a B-1B Lancer aircraft conducts a demonstration on in TanTan, Morocco. 1st Sgt. John Etheridge/US Army/File ‘Blatant American violation’ Iraq and Syria condemned the US attack as infringements on their sovereignty that risk fueling regional conflict. In a statement, Yahya Rasool, a spokesperson for Iraq’s Armed Forces, decried the strikes as a “violation of Iraqi sovereignty.” “The city of Al-Qaim and the Iraqi border areas are being subjected to airstrikes by US aircraft, at a time when Iraq is striving hard to ensure the stability of the region,” Rasool said. “These strikes are considered a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and undermine the efforts of the Iraqi government, posing a threat that could drag Iraq and the region into undesirable consequences, the outcomes will be dire for the security and stability in Iraq and the region,” the spokesman continued. The mayor of Al-Qaim, Turki Al-Mahalawi, said the strikes hit three houses used as weapon warehouses by the PMU. The US struck targets there last month. Syria warned that the US strikes “fuel the conflict in the Middle East in a very dangerous way,” and expressed “deep concern about the state of paralysis that the UN Security Council is suffering from.” “(Syria) condemns this blatant American violation (and) it categorically rejects all the pretexts and lies promoted by the American administration to justify this attack,” the Syrian foreign ministry said in a statement . Echoing both, Iran warned the strikes would only escalate tensions. “Iran considers the attacks as a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, international law and a clear violation of the United Nations Charter,” Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement Friday. The attack is “an adventurous action and another strategic mistake by the US government, which will have no result other than intensifying tension and instability in the region,” the statement added. ‘We don’t seek a war with Iran’ Biden had been under increasing pressure to respond to the soldiers’ deaths in a way that stops the militia attacks for good, CNN previously reported. Iran-backed militants have targeted US military facilities in Iraq and Syria over 160 times since October, and several Republican lawmakers had called for the US to hit inside Iran directly to send a clear message. But administration officials have been clear that any response would be proportionate as to not further escalate things in the region. A senior administration official confirmed to CNN that the US will not strike inside Iran – only focusing on targets outside of the country. “We don’t seek a war with Iran. We’re not looking for a wider conflict in the Middle East,” Kirby told CNN on Monday. On Wednesday the White House said it believes an umbrella group of militants called Islamic Resistance in Iraq was behind the drone attack in Jordan. “We believe that the attack in Jordan was planned, resourced and facilitated by an umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which contains multiple groups including Kata’ib Hezbollah,” Kirby said. He stopped short of assigning exact blame on Kata’ib Hezbollah, the most powerful Iran-backed militia in Iraq, saying it was not the only group responsible for previous attacks on US bases. “This certainly has the earmarks of the kinds of things that Kata’ib Hezbollah does,” he said, adding, “The attribution that that our intelligence community is comfortable with is that this was done by the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.” The US military has carried out several strikes targeting Iranian proxies’ weapons depots in Iraq and Syria since October, but none of those strikes deterred the militants, whose 165 attacks injured over 120 US service members across the region. Iran has spent years investing in these regional proxy groups, informally known as the “axis of resistance,” supplying them with money, weapons, and training as Tehran has sought to broaden its influence in the Middle East and pressure the United States to disengage from the region. None of the proxy groups’ other attacks since October, however, have resulted in the deaths of US service members. Sunday’s attack marked a significant escalation that Biden and his national security team believed they were compelled to respond to forcefully. Kirby said Friday that while the US did inform the Iraqi government of its plans ahead of time, there was no communication with Iran — backchannel or otherwise — over the killing of the three US soldiers. Iran has repeatedly said that it is not seeking conflict. On Friday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said his country will not initiate a war but will “respond strongly” to bullies. “We have said many times that we will not start any war; but if an oppressive country or force wants to bully us, the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond strongly,” he said in a televised speech in the southern Iranian Hormozgan province. There have been mixed messages from the militias though. In a sign of a possible effort to quell the tensions, Kataib Hezbollah, announced on Tuesday the suspension of its military operations against US forces in the region. “We are announcing the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces (US troops) - in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government,” Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement. “We will continue to defend our people in Gaza in other ways, and we recommend to the brave Mujahideen of the Free Hezbollah Brigades to [carry out] passive defense (temporarily) if any hostile American action occurs towards them.” But on Friday the leader of the Al-Nujaba militant group, Akram Al-Kaabi, said it would continue to attack US targets. The strikes also come amid negotiations over a framework for a hostage release deal and potential ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. An official told CNN this week that a broad framework of a deal was agreed to by negotiators, but that the “details are going to be very difficult” to work out.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/trump-trial-date-postponed/index.html,"Washington CNN — The Washington, DC, trial date in the federal election subversion case against former President Donald Trump has been postponed because of ongoing appeals about the power of the presidency, according to a new court order in the case. The trial date was originally set for March 4, but the case was paused as a federal appeals court considers arguments from Trump that he should be immune from prosecution because of his role as president leading up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The appeals court has yet to issue a ruling on the matter of immunity. Though not official until US District Judge Tanya Chutkan’s order Friday, it became increasingly less likely that the March trial date would hold. In January, Trump’s team complained that prosecutors were continuing to submit court filings despite the case’s pause, and Chutkan warned Smith’s team that they should not continue without her permission. The delay is a win for the former president, who has repeatedly worked to delay the trial until after the 2024 presidential election, but it isn’t yet clear if he’ll be successful in holding off the trial until after November’s vote. Two Trump advisers told CNN that the former president’s team will continue to push for further delays and that its key focus in the latest court order is that Chutkan has not set a new trial date. A delay was also anticipated by the parties and even court officials – especially as each day has gone by without a ruling from the DC Circuit on presidential immunity. The court heard the case almost a month ago and can take weeks if not months to rule. It’s likely that the ruling from the DC Circuit will be appealed to the Supreme Court. As part of her order Friday, Chutkan also said that the prospective jurors, who had been asked to appear in court next week to fill out a written questionnaire, would no longer have to do so. “The court will set a new schedule if and when the mandate is returned,” Chutkan wrote in the order. Trump faces four counts from special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion charges, including conspiring to defraud the United States and to obstruct an official proceeding. The former president has pleaded not guilty. The federal case against Trump had been set to begin first among the criminal indictments he faces. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is set to take Trump to trial in late March for allegedly falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. Trump’s team, as well as legal experts, view the hush money case as much weaker than the others, the former president’s advisers told CNN. The campaign feels that having the Bragg trial go first will help them set the stage for their core argument that these trials are purely political and designed to hurt his chances in a general election, the advisers added. Court proceedings in his case around the handling of documents after the presidency at Mar-a-Lago currently are focused around the use of classified evidence in the case. A trial is on the schedule for late May but may need to be moved back because of those proceedings. The Mar-a-Lago documents case judge, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee in south Florida, has left open the possibility of revisiting the trial schedule at a hearing March 1. The state-level judge presiding over Trump’s 2020 election conspiracy in Georgia has yet to set a trial date. This story has been updated with additional information.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/jack-smith-defends-mar-a-lago-search-case/index.html,"Washington CNN — Special counsel Jack Smith’s office is defending how the federal government during Joe Biden’s presidency sought to repossess White House records Donald Trump took, and how the case evolved into a federal investigation. The expansive, 67-page filing offers a detailed retelling of the standoff with Trump as a way to “set the record straight,” Smith’s prosecutors say, on the origins of the Mar-a-Lago documents case, as they fight to keep the case on track for a spring trial. After the search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, in August 2022, federal investigators pursued a “careful and thorough investigation,” seeking information from intelligence agencies, the National Archives and other parts of the federal government before bringing criminal charges against Trump for mishandling documents, the special counsel’s office said. The prosecutors say Trump’s legal team has attempted to distort the events in his favor – including by claiming he had a security clearance that extended past his presidency. He is seeking to convince a federal judge in Florida to force the Justice Department to give him more documents as evidence in the case from several sensitive parts of the federal government, including the Biden White House, the Department of Energy and the US intelligence community. Prosecutors’ retelling of the investigation on Friday is based on documents they’ve turned over to Trump’s legal team already that may be used as evidence in the upcoming trial against him, according to the filing. “Federal agencies confronted, and appropriately responded to, an extraordinary situation resulting entirely from the defendants’ conduct,” the prosecutors wrote. “The law required that those documents be collected,” the prosecutors also said in the filing. White House communications The dispute of what happened dates to the end of the Trump presidency and early days of the Biden White House, when it became clear to federal government agencies and to Trump’s representatives that boxes of presidential documents were missing. Specifically, prosecutors say then-White House lawyer Jonathan Su, who worked under Biden, spoke with Trump aides who handled his presidential records post-presidency and with the National Archives, at a time when the groups had to coordinate discussions about missing presidential records. Trump has tried to claim Su’s involvement – and the role of his successor’s White House in discussions about his presidential records – was improper. But the prosecutors on Friday wrote Trump’s team “not only knew” of the Biden White House being part of the discussion, they also approved of it. “The White House Counsel’s Office became involved because of the need to consult its personnel about missing Trump Administration Presidential records,” the prosecutors wrote on Friday. Later, in early 2022, when presidential records from Trump’s White House were shipped back to the National Archives , archivists found classified records among them, prompting them to contact the Justice Department to begin a criminal investigation. Trump has taken issue with how the DOJ handled the investigation and has accused various agencies of working together to smear him after he left the presidency. On Friday, the special counsel’s office argued the case’s evolution followed Justice Department protocol, including in how White House employees spoke with DOJ officials. “The record shows only different government agencies, with specific portfolios and responsibilities, at work to solve an increasingly vexing and concerning problem,” prosecutors said. “The defendants’ legal problems are solely of their own making.” Prosecutors say Trump did not hold a security clearance after leaving office Smith’s team said that they scoured all records and found no evidence Trump held security clearance after he left office, despite his attorneys claiming he did . Trump’s attorneys have argued that the former president held the security clearance from the Department of Energy – which works with the nation’s nuclear arsenal – after he left office, which, they said, could support an argument that Trump was acting in a good faith and “non-criminal states of mind relating to possession of classified materials” in Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors produced a memorandum from the assistant general counsel in Department of Energy, which stated that Trump did have a high security clearance, called Q clearance, in connection with his “duties” as president, but that “Trump’s clearance had terminated upon the end of his presidency.” Trump’s name was inadvertently left on the DOE database as having the Q clearance after his term ended, the general counsel wrote in their memo, and was “belatedly updated to reflect that reality” when DOE officials learned of the mistake. “But even if Trump’s Q clearance had remained active, that fact would not give him the right to take any documents containing information subject to the clearance to his home and store it in his basement or anywhere else at Mar-a-Lago,” prosecutors wrote. “No Q clearance holder has authorization to remove documents from a proper place of storage and keep them for himself. And a Q clearance would not even permit access to, much less offsite possession of, the documents charged in Counts 1-18 and 20-32.” Additionally, prosecutors produced search results from the Scattered Castles database, which records the security clearances maintained by the Intelligence Community, and from Department of Defense databases. Prosecutors wrote that their searches “yielded no past or present security clearances for Trump.” The documents are among more than 1.28 million pages of unclassified discovery that prosecutors have given Trump’s defense lawyers in the classified documents case. Those documents include key records from their investigation, security footage from Mar-a-Lago, information that defense lawyers could use to impeach potential trial witnesses, and records about “secured facilities that could be used to accommodate access to classified information at properties associated with Trump during his presidency.” The special counsel’s team has also turned over a significant amount of information on the search at Mar-a-Lago on August 8, 2022. That information, prosecutors wrote, includes the FBI operations plan for the search, chain of custody reports and descriptions of evidence seized, CCTV footage from the day of the search, communications obtained from Trump Organization and Mar-a-Lago employees from that day, photographs taken during the search, inventories of the documents found at the property, and the documents that the FBI seized. Defense lawyers have access to a significant amount of Secret Service records, according to prosecutors, including plans for enhanced security at Mar-a-Lago, records of security breaches at Mar-a-Lago and the fact that “approximately 48,000 guests who visited Mar-a-Lago between January 2021 and May 2022, while classified documents were at the property,” but only “2,200 had their names checked and only 2,900 passed through magnetometers.” Additionally, prosecutors turned over “all discoverable material from (the National Archives) within its possession” and “all discoverable material stemming from the investigating agents’ contacts with FBI Headquarters.” Fight over evidence In their filing, prosecutors argue that Trump and his co-defendants in the case are not entitled to the internal government communications the former president is seeking as part of discovery, which, they say, are protected by law as work products of the team of prosecutors. Trump’s attorneys, in a filing in mid-January, sought access to Biden-era White House records and records from the Intelligence Community, arguing that Biden’s administration “took steps to create a false appearance of separation from the investigation.” Prosecutors, however, shot back, saying that much of the specific requests from Trump’s team “seek evidence from agencies – including NARA, the White House, and the Intelligence Community – that are not part of the prosecution team.” They added: “No personnel from the National Security Council, the White House Counsel’s Office, the Office of Records Management, or any other White House component participated in any interviews (except as witnesses), presented the case to the grand jury, accompanied prosecutors to any court proceedings, or played any role in the development of prosecutorial strategy.” Additionally, the Intelligence Community “played no investigatory role in this case,” the filing says, and were therefore not part of the prosecution team. Smith’s team also says that some of the evidence Trump is looking for either does not exist or isn’t in prosecutor’s possession. According to the filing, there has not been any communication between prosecutors and Biden or senior White House political officials either about the investigation or otherwise. “To be clear, the defendants’ requests are predicated on a false narrative,” prosecutors wrote of Trump’s claims that the Justice Department is targeting him for political purposes. Prosecutors continued: “The investigation and prosecution of this case have been appropriately driven by the facts and the law, not by any form of political bias.” Smith’s team argued that Trump should also not be allowed to use this claim of selective prosecution as part of his defense at trial because it’s an issue for the judge to decide, not a jury. “The well-settled proposition,” prosecutors wrote, is “that selective-prosecution claims have no place at trial.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/us-capitol-police-subpoenaed-cori-bush-grand-jury-probe/index.html,"CNN — US Capitol Police have received a subpoena in the grand jury investigation into Rep. Cori Bush, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The subpoena is seeking materials related to threats directed toward the Missouri Democrat and communications from her office, her campaign, or her husband with Capitol Police, one of the sources said. A separate source familiar with the matter told CNN the previous subpoena to the House sergeant at arms also requested information about any threats and incidents involving Bush. A federal grand jury in Washington, DC, has been asking questions about Bush’s security and the potential misuse of funds in recent months, according to people familiar with the investigation, and the probe has included outreach to other witnesses in addition to the earlier subpoenaed House sergeant at arms and Capitol Police. Federal investigators also have reached out to other potential witnesses, including some involved in the personal security business, several sources said. The investigation is still in a fledgling phase, some of the sources said, and Bush hasn’t been charged with any crime. A lawyer for Bush did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. The federal investigative activity around Bush adds to scrutiny of the congresswoman, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Security spending Last year, the conservative group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission saying Bush may have misused campaign funds by paying her now-husband Cortney Merritts, more than $60,000 for security services during her 2022 campaign. Merritts and Bush married in February 2023. FEC filings show that from January 19, 2023, through April 3, 2023, Bush’s campaign paid Merritts $15,000 for “security services” in six payments of $2,500.  The filings show that on April 14, 2023, the campaign began paying Merritts $2,500 twice a month for “wage expenses,” through September 26, 2023, the last date for which data is available. CNN asked Bush’s campaign if either she or Merritts were interviewed by the FBI, and if the campaign could provide timesheets for Merritts. The campaign declined to comment citing the pending federal investigation. Merritts does not have a current private security license, according to local records, which is required for individuals who perform security services in St. Louis, Missouri, where Bush’s campaign is headquartered. The address listed for Merritts in FEC filings is the same as Bush’s campaign headquarters. Bush said in October that the Office of Congressional Ethics had voted to dismiss a similar complaint, according to reports at the time. FEC rules allow for candidates to hire family members if they’re paid fair market value for a bona fide service. The congresswoman said she is “fully cooperating” with the Justice Department’s investigation in a statement Tuesday. “First and foremost, I hold myself, my campaign, and my position to the highest levels of integrity,” Bush said in the statement. “I also believe in transparency which is why I can confirm that the Department of Justice is reviewing my campaign’s spending on security services. We are fully cooperating in this investigation, and I would like to take this opportunity to outline the facts and the truth,” she added. She maintained she has not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services and that she complied with House rules. Bush further explained she retained her husband’s security services “because he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate.“"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/supreme-court-west-point-admissions/index.html,"Washington CNN — The Supreme Court said Friday that the United States Military Academy at West Point can continue considering race as a factor in its admissions process while a legal challenge to the practice plays out. The decision is a temporary blow to the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, or SFFA, whose lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina led the Supreme Court last year to declare race-based admissions policies unlawful – except at US military service academies. The court said in a brief order that the record in the case “is underdeveloped” and that its decision “should not be construed as expressing any view on the merits of the constitutional question.” The carveout in last year’s rulings led SFFA to sue West Point and the US Naval Academy in 2023, alleging in two separate lawsuits that the military academies’ use of race in their admissions processes is unconstitutional. Lower courts have declined to grant the group’s request to order the schools to stop the practice while the lawsuits play out. Last week, SFFA asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to block West Point from considering race in its admissions process as the litigation unfolds. “For now, the only question is what should happen as this case proceeds – who should bear the burden of the status quo,” attorneys for SFFA told the Supreme Court. “Every year this case languishes in discovery, trial, or appeals, West Point will label and sort thousands more applicants based on their skin color – including the class of 2028, which West Point will start choosing in earnest once the application deadline closes on January 31. “Should these young Americans bear the burden of West Point’s unchecked racial discrimination? Or should West Point bear the burden of temporarily complying with the Constitution’s command of racial equality?” they added in part. Though the application to the high court was filed at the same time a similar one from the group was pending before a New York-based federal appeals court, the intermediate court also turned down the group’s request earlier this week. The Biden administration had urged the Supreme Court to not intervene in the matter, stressing the injunction sought by SFFA would be “profoundly disruptive” for West Point since the school’s application and selection process is already well underway. “SFFA would have this Court compel West Point to alter its admissions process overnight, retrain admissions officers midstream, restart consideration of candidates for whom a decision has not yet been announced, and either rescind offers already issued or apply different criteria to candidates based on the happenstance of when their applications were reviewed,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers. Prelogar also defended the academy’s use of race in its admissions process, warning that a “lack of diversity in leadership can jeopardize the Army’s ability to win wars.” “For more than forty years, our Nation’s military leaders have determined that a diverse Army officer corps is a national-security imperative and that achieving that diversity requires limited consideration of race in selecting those who join the Army as cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point,” she told the court. In a ruling issued January 3 , US District Judge Philip M. Halpern wrote that while it’s possible West Point may have to ultimately stop considering race like other civilian universities, it’s also possible the school can prove it has “compelling governmental interests” to conduct its admissions process the way it does. Like Prelogar, the judge also raised concerns about how the preliminary injunction SFFA asked for could “disrupt” the admissions process for two admissions cycles and cause the school to make drastic changes at a critical time. “The requested injunction, to take effect on February 1, 2024, would require the entire admissions policy to be changed, and a new policy be applied to the current applicant pool midstream, as well as to applicants to the new admissions cycle beginning on February 1, 2024,” he wrote. In its lawsuit against West Point, SFFA argued the school “has no justification for using race-based admissions” and said its policy “discriminates on the basis of race.” “West Point sets benchmarks for the percentage of each class that should be filled by ‘African Americans,’ ‘Hispanics,’ and ‘Asians,’ and it meticulously tracks its compliance with those figures down to a tenth of a percentage point,” the suit claimed. “Race is, indeed, determinative for hundreds of applicants each year.” The Supreme Court’s ruling last June said colleges and universities could no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admissions – except at US military service academies. It was a significant decision against affirmative action policies, which have focused on improving opportunities for historically excluded minorities. In a footnote in the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said the cases before the court did “not address the issue” and left open the possibility that there are “potentially distinct interests that military academies may present” in a future case. SFFA brought its lawsuit against the Naval Academy in October. A federal judge in Maryland declined in December to temporarily block the school from considering race in its admissions decisions while that legal challenge plays out. US District Judge Richard Bennett said in his ruling that because a “factual record” has not been developed in the case, it’s “unclear whether SFFA is likely to succeed on the merits at this stage.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/connecticut-cancel-medical-debt/index.html,"CNN — Connecticut will cancel roughly $650 million in medical debt for an estimated 250,000 residents this year, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday, saying it is the first state to provide this type of relief. The effort will liberate many residents from “the cloud” over their heads and give them more freedom to buy a home, start a business or continue with their education, Lamont told CNN. That will help them strengthen their financial standing in a state with a large wealth gap. “It’s a debt that you had no control over,” Lamont told CNN. “It’s not like you overspent. You get hit by a health care calamity.” Residents whose medical debt equals 5% or more of their annual income or whose household income is up to 400% of the federal poverty line, or about $125,000 in 2024, are eligible. Those who qualify do not need to apply – they will receive letters in the mail saying their debt has been eliminated as soon as this summer. More than 1 in 10 Connecticut residents have medical debt in collections. Lamont first announced the initiative, which was included in Connecticut’s most recent budget, on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday. The state will leverage $6.5 million in Covid-19 funds from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act to satisfy the debt. It will contract with a nonprofit group that buys medical debt from hospitals and eliminates it for much less than what’s owed. Connecticut joins a growing number of governments that are wiping out residents’ unpaid medical bills. New Jersey included $10 million in its most recent budget to fund a pilot program to cancel residents’ medical debt, and Gov. Phil Murphy last month called on the state Legislature to expand the effort in the coming budget. “For every dollar invested, we can retire up to $100 in debt – for tens of thousands of people,” Murphy said in his State of the State address. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced the medical debt cancellation effort on Friday. Jessica Hill/AP/File New York City last month said it would eliminate more than $2 billion in medical debt for up to 500,000 residents over the next three years. Many governments are working with RIP Medical Debt, a nonprofit founded in 2014. It can often buy debt directly from hospitals and other health care providers for a penny on the dollar, mimicking the deals that for-profit debt collectors are able to strike, said Allison Sesso, CEO of the charity. It has signed contracts or is working with about 30 governments, including cities, counties and states – many of which are using American Rescue Plan Act funds to pay for the initiatives. However, she noted, the efforts can’t guarantee that all of a person’s medical debt will be canceled. Helping patients contend with medical debt is in the spotlight as Americans deal with the high cost of health care. The exact amount owed is difficult to pin down, but a KFF analysis of 2020 Census Bureau data found that US adults carry at least $195 billion in medical debt. Nearly 1 in 10 American adults have medical debt of over $250, with Black Americans and middle-aged residents more likely to be in this situation, according to KFF. A separate analysis last year by Third Way, a center-left think tank, found that the middle class is the hardest hit by unpaid health care bills. Medical debt is now the largest source of debt in collections, totaling more than credit cards, utilities and auto loans combined, according to the White House. The three largest credit reporting agencies announced in 2022 that they would remove nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Biden administration are also considering ways to minimize the burden of medical debt.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/illicit-iranian-programs-targeted-us-measures/index.html,"Washington CNN — The US announced a number of measures including sanctions and criminal charges targeting a range of malicious Iranian initiatives, including their cyberwarfare and drone programs, as well as Iran’s alleged illegal oil trafficking to fund foreign terrorist organizations. The actions come as the Biden administration vowed to carry out a “multi-tiered” response to a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on a US military outpost in Jordan on Sunday, which killed three US service members and wounded more than 40 others. The Justice Department announced charges Friday against four Iranian nationals, including a “senior official” in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and three Turkish nationals for allegedly participating in a “long-running scheme” to facilitate the “black-market sales of Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products” according to the indictment . The seven defendants face charges including supporting a foreign terrorist organization. In a separate case announced Friday, prosecutors also charged a Chinese individual and an Omani individual with sanctions evasion and money laundering allegedly connected to “the trafficking and selling of Iranian oil to Chinese government-owned refineries,” according to a news release. “The Justice Department will continue to use every authority we have to cut off the illegal financing and enabling of Iran’s malicious activities, which have become even more evident in recent months,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement. DOJ also charged a Chinese individual and an Omani individual in Washington, DC with sanctions evasion and money laundering allegedly connected to “the trafficking and selling of Iranian oil to Chinese government-owned refineries,” according to a press release. The Justice Department also announced the seizure of more than $108 million, and efforts to seize an additional $8.5 million and 500,000 barrels of fuel in connection with Iran’s alleged oil trafficking. “Iran presents a constant threat to the United States – trying to murder Americans right here within our borders, conducting a cyber-attack on a children’s hospital, supporting terrorists around the world, and more. … And the FBI will remain committed to enforcing U.S. sanctions that keep money out of its coffers,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement. Earlier in the day, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against several Iran- and Hong Kong-based companies for allegedly supporting Iran’s drone program and missile production. The three alleged front companies in Hong Kong and an Iranian subsidiary allegedly obtained components, such as engines and carburetors, for Iran’s drone program. “We will not hesitate to leverage our full suite of tools to disrupt the illicit procurement networks that supply the components for these weapons systems, as well as hold accountable those who seek to export these weapons to terrorist proxy groups,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson in a statement. Treasury also announced sanctions targeting the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber–Electronic Command and five other senior officials for alleged cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in the US and other countries. Iran allegedly hacked into “programmable logic controllers” used in critical infrastructure “to display an anti-Israel message” on their interfaces, according to State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller. That’s a reference to a series of hacks that defaced computers at multiple water utilities in the US in November. While the hacks didn’t cause damage to the facilities or affect drinking water, they alarmed US officials for their brazenness. “The ultimate purpose of these hacks is to scare us and attack our trust in our own basic safety. Unfortunately, they can be effective even when they fail to disrupt the services they target, which this actor knows,” John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN. US officials have long seen Iran’s considerable cyber capabilities as an unpredictable and potentially destabilizing variable in the US-Iranian rivalry.  US government blamed Iran for an attempted cyberattack on Boston Children’s Hospital in 2021 in what FBI Director Christopher Wray called “one of the most despicable cyberattacks I’ve ever seen.” (Tehran denied the allegations.) “Although [the recent hacks at water facilities] did not disrupt any critical services, unauthorized access to critical infrastructure systems can enable actions that harm the public and cause devastating humanitarian consequences,” the Treasury Department said in a statement on Friday.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/george-santos-special-election-fundraising/index.html,"CNN — Democrats hold a significant cash advantage as well as the edge on the airwaves in the race to succeed disgraced former Rep. George Santos , according to new campaign filings and advertising data. The high-stakes special election for New York’s 3rd Congressional District on the north shore of Long Island is set for February 13, and Democrats are eager to flip the seat and cut into House Republicans’ thin majority . In 2022, Santos won what had been a longtime Democratic-held seat by about 8 points, and the race to succeed the Republican could offer important clues about the political climate early in this election year. The Democratic nominee for the special election is former Rep. Tom Suozzi , a long-term fixture in local politics who held the seat for three terms before vacating it for an unsuccessful 2022 run for governor. His Republican opponent, Mazi Pilip , is a Nassau County legislator and an Israeli immigrant who was born in Ethiopia and served in the Israel Defense Forces. Under New York’s special election rules, both nominees were selected by the county party leaders in the district. Suozzi raised more than three times as much as Pilip, $4.5 million to $1.3 million , according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission that covered the beginning of October through January 24. Suozzi also outspent Pilip, $2.4 million to $714,000, over that time span. And crucially, Suozzi held a large cash-on-hand advantage entering the race’s final weeks, with about $2.2 million banked to $629,000 for Pilip. Prior to being tapped for the special election, Suozzi had launched a challenge to Santos in October, about a month before the congressman announced he would not seek reelection . In December, Santos became only the sixth lawmaker to be expelled from Congress , bringing to an end a scandal-plagued and tumultuous tenure on Capitol Hill. A House Ethics Committee report concluded he had “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” Santos has also pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges , including allegations that he stole donors’ identities and ran up thousands of dollars in fraudulent charges on their credit cards, misused campaign funds and lied about his personal finances on House disclosure reports. He faces a possible trial later this year. Video Ad Feedback Why the GOP is backing a registered-Democrat for George Santos' seat 03:41 - Source: CNN On the airwaves In addition to Suozzi’s cash advantage, Democrats have held the edge on air in the special election, according to AdImpact data. Including national party committees and outside groups, Democrats have outspent Republicans on advertising by about $9.9 million to $6.4 million. The flood of advertising has been led by a pair of super PACs from each side, House Majority PAC for the Democrats, and Congressional Leadership Fund for Republicans, each of which has spent around $4 million on ads since January. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, has also made a significant investment, spending about $3.9 million on the race, while its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has spent about $964,000, plus about $885,000 on a joint effort with Pilip. In their ads, Democrats have leveled a variety of criticisms against Pilip, saying she “would join MAGA Republicans” in Congress to support spending cuts, threaten Social Security and restrict abortion. Suozzi’s campaign, meanwhile, has rolled out ads touting his character and constituent services, and also responding to attacks from Republicans, particularly on the issue of immigration. WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 01: Rep. George Santos (R-NY) is surrounded by journalists as he leaves the U.S. Capitol after his fellow members of Congress voted to expel him from the House of Representatives on December 01, 2023 in Washington, DC. Charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with 23 felonies in New York including fraud and campaign finance violations, Santos, 35, was expelled from the House of Representatives by a vote of 311-114. Santos is only the sixth person in U.S. history to be expelled from the House of Representatives.

The Congressional Leadership Fund has spent more than a million airing an ad accusing Suozzi of “rolling out the red carpet for illegal immigrants,” and nearly a million more on another spot saying he “helped create our immigration crisis in Congress.” And Pilip’s campaign, in a joint effort with the NRCC, produced an ad echoing that messaging, asserting that President Joe Biden ’s policies “are opening the border” and that “Biden and the Democrats let in 10 million migrants.” The winner of the special election to succeed Santos will serve out the remainder of his term. The primary for the regular full term will be held in June. But the district’s boundaries beyond the special election remain uncertain, as New York’s highest court has ordered the state to redraw its congressional map this year . The state’s Democratic-controlled Legislature would have ultimate say over the new lines . Biden would have carried the 3rd District under its current lines by 8 points in 2020. But the GOP has made gains in elections on Long Island since then, largely around concerns about crime, immigration and inflation, including the high cost of housing.

The filing from Willis, who is spearheading the Georgia criminal case against former President Donald Trump and his allies over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, includes an affidavit from Wade, who says that in 2022 he and Willis “developed a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship.” Wade denied that his earnings on the case have been “shared with or provided to” Willis. “The District Attorney received no funds or personal financial gain from my position as Special Prosecutor,” he said. Willis also said their “personal relationship … has never involved direct or indirect financial benefit to District Attorney Willis.” Willis filed the response to allegations by one of Trump’s co-defendants of a conflict of interest and improper romantic relationship with Wade. Willis said in the court filing that the “salacious” allegations do not reach the legal grounds required for her to be disqualified from the Georgia election interference case. “While the allegations raised in the various motions are salacious and garnered the media attention they were designed to obtain, none provide this Court with any basis upon which to order the relief they seek,” the filing stated. Willis said that defense attorneys did not reach the legal basis for disqualification, writing that she has no financial or personal conflict of interest that “constitutes a legal basis for disqualification,” and that she “has made no public statements that warrant disqualification or judicial inquiry.” The motion also defended Wade, saying that the attacks on his qualifications are “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious, in addition to providing no basis whatsoever to dismiss the indictment or disqualify Special Prosecutor Wade.” “Defendants do not point to any action taken by the District Attorney or any of her staff that has been outside the character of an officer of the law specially charged to oversee either the special purpose grand jury’s investigation or the prosecution of these Defendants,” the motion reads. “Instead, the motions attempt to cobble together entirely unremarkable circumstances of Special Prosecutor Wade’s appointment with completely irrelevant allegations about his personal family life into a manufactured conflict of interest on the part of the District Attorney. The effort must fail.” Wade and Willis respond to allegations of improper conduct The judge overseeing the criminal case had ordered Willis to respond – setting the stage for a February 15 hearing on the matter. Willis, Wade and some of their colleagues could be forced to testify at the hearing after receiving subpoenas this week. Addressing allegations that the two took vacations together, Willis wrote that the “financial responsibility for personal travel taken is divided roughly evenly between the two, with neither being primarily responsible for expenses of the other, and all expenses paid for with individual personal funds.” In his affidavit, Wade said: “At times I have made and purchased travel for District Attorney Willis and myself from my personal funds. At other times District Attorney Willis has made and purchased travel for she and I from her personal funds.” Willis added that “there are no joint or shared finances or financial accounts,” that “there is not now and has never been any shared household,” and that neither Willis nor Wade are financially reliant on the other. Citing Wade’s affidavit, Willis wrote that “Defendants offer no support for their insistence that the exercise of any prosecutorial discretion (i.e., any charging decision or plea recommendation) in this case was impacted by any personal relationship.” “Without those additional factors, the existence of a relationship between members of a prosecution team, in and of itself, is simply not a status that entitles a criminal defendant any remedy,” she continued. In the spring of 2021, Wade was asked by Willis, along with two other attorneys, to assist in the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “Lawyers we spoke with about taking on the work expressed hesitation due to concerns related to violent rhetoric and potential safety issues for their families,” Wade said, adding that he initially pushed back when Willis asked him to serve as Special Prosecutor in the 2020 election subversion case. Willis argues that the February 15 hearing is not necessary and should be canceled. “Defendants’ failure to support their demands for extreme relief with evidence that would support any remedy makes an evidentiary hearing on this matter unnecessary,” Willis wrote in a court filing Friday responding to the allegations. “The State respectfully asks that, after consideration of the (Nathan) Wade Affidavit and other submitted exhibits, the motions be denied without further spectacle.” Willis has no plan to step down CNN previously reported that Willis has no plans to step down from the election subversion case, a decision driven in part over concern that her departure could effectively end the case, as it’s unclear if there’s another prosecutor in Georgia willing to take it on. While the allegations have become a huge public focus and distraction for Willis’ office, she had not directly addressed the allegations for weeks but did broadly defend Wade and her team. The alleged affair was first raised by Trump’s co-defendant, former 2020 campaign official Mike Roman, last month in a court filing that accused Willis of financially benefiting when Wade took her on lavish vacations, partly paid for with what he billed her office for work on the case. Willis appointed Wade special prosecutor in 2021. But there was little direct evidence included in that initial filing seeking her dismissal and for the case to be tossed, an effort Trump has since joined. Since then, credit card statements revealed in Wade’s divorce case show he paid for two plane tickets for Willis to San Francisco and Miami. Trump and the 14 remaining co-defendants were indicted by Willis last summer. No trial date has been set yet. Willis has asked for a trial date to be scheduled for August. Four other co-defendants have already pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to testify. CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/biden-delaware-dignified-transfer-jordan-attack/index.html,"CNN — For an American president, it is the gravest of responsibilities: witnessing the country’s war dead return home for what the military calls a “dignified transfer.” President Joe Biden attended his second as commander in chief on Friday, honoring the three American soldiers killed in a drone attack in Jordan last weekend as their remains arrive back on US soil. “They risked it all,” Biden said a day ahead of making the trip to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. No, the occasion isn’t a “ceremony,” according to the military’s language. Nor are the flag-draped boxes that arrive to Dover “coffins” — they are “transfer cases” loaded onto trucks for processing at the base mortuary, the largest in the country. The precise vocabulary, briefed to reporters who attend the transfers, is an extension of the mournful precision that unfolds nearly identically on the tarmac every time a US service member dies in service of the nation. Dictated by ritual, dignity and utmost attention to the needs and wishes of grieving families, the transfers are a searing reminder for a president of the consequences of his decisions and the weight of the job. They have become rarer as the US winds down the foreign wars that defined the first decades of the century. Biden witnessed the transfer Friday of Sgt. William Rivers, 46; and two Army specialists who were posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant: Kennedy Sanders, 24, and Breonna Moffett, 23. All are from Georgia. The US has yet to retaliate for the drone attack in Jordan that left the three Americans dead and more than 40 injured, though it has pinned blame on an umbrella group of Iran-backed militants in Iraq. A multiphase counterstrike is expected soon, officials have said. On Friday, however, Biden’s attention was on the Americans lost and the families they left behind. His schedule allowed for more than an hour midday to meet with the families of the fallen Americans, alongside first lady Jill Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown. Biden met with each of the families at the Center for Families of the Fallen prior to attending the dignified transfer, according to the White House. In past meetings, families have shared memories of their loved ones — or, as has sometimes been the case, exchanged tense words with the president — in private. After, the president and those accompanying him move outside to the tarmac, where the military plane carrying the remains of their loved ones awaits. The families are brought onto the tarmac and positioned a few hundred feet from the plane. A bus shields them from view of the media. One by one, the cases are carried with practiced, solemn precision by teams of seven from the bay of the military cargo plane and onto waiting gray mortuary vans. The transfers occur in near silence; the hum of the plane’s auxiliary power pierced only by occasional sobs from family members watching nearby and an officer’s calls to “present arms” when cases emerge. Once the remains are transferred from the plane, they are driven to the base mortuary, prepared for burial and transferred onward. Presidents don’t always attend the ritual, and media were allowed to document them only beginning in 2009. “Having at least some of these transfers publicly documented, I felt, gave our country a clearer means to reckon with the costs of war, the pain of each loss,” former President Barack Obama wrote in his memoir. Aides to presidents who have attended dignified transfers in the past describe their bosses as visibly affected by the experience on the flight home. Obama went to two dignified transfers at Dover; Trump went to four, once bringing with him actor Jon Voigt in a last-minute invite. Biden has attended three, including when he was vice president and as a senator for Delaware. He once claimed he was being blocked from attending dignified transfers at Dover by the Pentagon, describing times when he wanted to pay his respects but wasn’t allowed. He attended his first as president in 2021 , when 13 US service members were killed in a terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport gates in Afghanistan. When he was meeting privately with families of the Americans killed in Kabul, he was confronted with raw anger and emotions; some of the family members had wrestled beforehand with whether they wanted to meet the president at all. This week, when Biden spoke by telephone to the families of the three Americans killed in Jordan, he gauged their feelings about his attendance at Dover on Friday for their loved ones’ dignified transfer. All were supportive of him being there. In video taken by the family of Sanders of their call with Biden, the president said he was looking at a photo of the 24-year-old, who he said had a beautiful smile. “Thank you, Mr. President,” her mother, Oneida Oliver-Sanders, told Biden. “She did light up every room she was in.” This story has been updated with additional information."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/house-impeachment-biden-republicans/index.html,"Story highlights Republicans have struggled to make a clear, tangible case for impeaching President Joe Biden One GOP lawmaker estimated there are around 20 House Republicans who are not convinced Biden's would-be impeachment is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate But Republican investigators have vowed it is too soon to make final judgements A growing number of senior House Republicans are coming to terms with a stark realization: It is unlikely that their monthslong investigation into Joe Biden will actually lead to impeaching the president. Top Republicans are not expected to make an official decision on whether to pursue impeachment articles until after a pair of high-stakes depositions later this month with Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James. But serious doubts are growing inside the GOP that they will be able to convince their razor-thin majority to back the politically perilous impeachment effort in an election-year, according to interviews with over a dozen Republican lawmakers and aides, including some who are close to the probe. While no formal whip count ahas been conducted, one GOP lawmaker estimated there are around 20 House Republicans who are not convinced there is evidence for impeachment, and Republicans can only lose two votes in the current House margins. Even conservative GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who serves on the House Oversight Committee and supports impeaching the president, acknowledged that it has been hard for the investigation to break through: “While I think that it’s pretty clear, I don’t know that the case has been made adequately to the American people.” And with a Biden impeachment expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate and the 2024 presidential election coming into focus, others say the best-case scenario at this point would be to leave it up to voters. “Let the American people decide in November if they want to take this country in a different direction,” GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York told CNN. “I think that’s probably most likely, considering the politics of the Senate.” The prospect of their inquiry not culminating in impeachment has prompted some internal frustration among Republicans, with finger-pointing already underway in GOP circles about what went wrong – and who is to blame – even as the Republican-led committees continue to push on with their probe. Some of the ire has been directed at House Oversight Chairman James Comer, who has spearheaded the investigation into Biden family business records. “You’d be hard pressed to say it’s going well,” said a GOP source closely following that investigation. “It’s a jumbled mess.” When the impeachment inquiry was launched four months ago under former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the conference was motivated to seize a top priority of their agenda and get to the bottom of accusations that the president was central to a family influence peddling scheme through his son’s foreign business dealings. But Republicans have struggled to articulate a clear, tangible case that rises to the level of an impeachable offense, multiple GOP lawmakers told CNN. In many cases, some of the GOP’s most damning claims about the president’s role in his son’s foreign business deals, put forward by Comer, have been undercut by their own witnesses. And the trio of committees leading the investigation have at times offered conflicting answers about what they think their most compelling piece of evidence is, sending mixed signals to the conference about the direction of their probe. Now, many feel that their window to capitalize on the inquiry is slipping away as they march closer to the November election. “I don’t think it goes anywhere,” one Republican lawmaker said of the Biden impeachment inquiry. “The window to impeach is rapidly closing,” another GOP source added. But investigators vowed it is too soon to make final judgements or promises about how the ongoing investigation ends up and praised the strategy and process so far. One senior GOP impeachment inquiry aide said it would be “a win too in our eyes” if the probe ended with legislative proposals to reform federal ethics laws, regardless of the decision on impeachment. “We are not trying to sell any case. We want to collect the facts and tell people what the facts are. And until we’ve gotten all the facts, it’s not the time or place to claim that we got something that we don’t have,” a senior GOP investigator told CNN. Meanwhile, attention has shifted inside the GOP conference to impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the southern border, where impeachment articles against are expected to hit the House floor as soon as next week. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, who is co-leading the investigation, acknowledged a Biden impeachment is not a forgone conclusion. “We don’t know. I mean that depends on the conference in the House of Representatives,” Jordan told CNN. The GOP committee chairmen, however, are still determined to make their case. This week, Jordan, Comer and Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, presented an update to the conservative Republican Study Committee on their probe, and there are regular meetings between the committees and the speaker’s office. For his part, Comer has long said that his job is not to impeach Biden – it’s to investigate. “I would vote to impeach him, but I’m not going to lose any sleep whether he gets impeached or not because we know the Senate’s not going to convict,” Comer said last month of the Democratic-controlled Senate. A number of GOP lawmakers praised Comer’s work, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. “Chairman Comer has worked tirelessly to conduct a thorough investigation into President BIden’s involvement in the Biden family’s shady business dealings and his Administration’s efforts to impede the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden,” Scalise said in a statement to CNN. ‘We don’t have the votes right now’ Republicans have struggled to get the full support of the conference behind their impeachment inquiry into Biden. “We don’t have the votes right now,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN. A number of lawmakers said that is because they still don’t see the evidence or are waiting for the investigation to conclude to make a final decision. GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who is not on any of the committees conducting the probe, told CNN, “I have seen nothing. I really see nothing. I know what people say. And I watch the news,” when asked if any evidence uncovered by the committees rose to the level of impeachment. GOP Rep. David Schweikert, who represents an Arizona district Biden won in 2020, said, “When the report is done, I’ll read it.” Another swing district Republican, Rep. Mike Garcia of California, who is waiting to see what the committees produce before making a final judgment, told CNN that when the committee chairs leading the investigation presented to a subsection of the conference this week they each gave updates on their work, but none said explicitly they had evidence of an impeachable offense. Pointing to the House Oversight Committee’s bank memos about Biden family business dealings, a senior GOP investigator said that the evidence is there, but “we need to maybe do a better job from a communications perspective at dumbing those memos down and turning them into graphics.” Others say it has not been a big focus of their already crowded agenda. “Nobody is talking about that,” said GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state, when asked for his thoughts on the Biden impeachment inquiry. Another swing district Republican, Rep. David Valadao of California, said: “I spend zero time on this.” Reflecting on balancing the different perspectives in the GOP conference, a senior GOP investigator said, “In today’s political environment, when you don’t have an instant conclusion and you’re not immediately able to forecast precisely what you’re going to do, members get a little frustrated.” Blame game heats up As the future of the probe remains uncertain, Republicans are unclear what their next move will be after Hunter Biden’s closed-door interview on February 28, with one GOP lawmaker calling that the “big decision point.” One senior GOP investigator said that while they want to continue to talk to witnesses, they want to be “mindful of wrapping this investigation up as quickly as we can” and hope to be in a position at the end of February to help members understand what they have found. While it is possible testimony from the president’s son changes the dynamics of the investigation, the blame game of what went wrong up until this point is already heating up. As Republicans fought to interview the president’s son in a closed-door setting, some GOP sources were frustrated that prior to sending the subpoena, Comer had previously gone on television and offered the president’s son the ability to testify in public, which Hunter Biden’s lawyers repeatedly referenced. He surprised Republicans involved in the probe when he told CNN his final report would have criminal referrals in it, a GOP source said. Comer also has gotten in hot water for his handling of witness transcripts and has held only one public hearing on his probe, which one senior GOP aide called at the time an “an unmitigated disaster.” A senior GOP impeachment inquiry aide defended Comer’s handling of the president’s son subpoena, saying they ultimately got what they wanted with an agreement on a closed-door deposition, and said the point of the first hearing was to establish a basis for the inquiry, not to determine whether there was evidence to impeach. Another senior GOP impeachment inquiry aide said Comer gets almost daily requests from members to go to their districts and speak about his committee’s work, and receives positive feedback when he updates the conference on the investigation. Still, there have been differences of opinion on what the committees should focus on and confusion for members trying to follow their work. “It makes it a little bit harder when you have a process that is very fragmented,” GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee said, referring to the many committees involved. “It’s becoming much more difficult.” CNN’s Haley Talbot contributed to this report."
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/gop-committee-subpoena-fani-willis/index.html,"Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been subpoenaed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan to produce documents related to the use and spending of federal funds, according to copy of the subpoena obtained by CNN. Willis is the Georgia district attorney who brought the 2020 election subversion case against former President Donald Trump. The subpoena is part of a broader investigation by Jordan, an Ohio Republican, that is focused on Willis’ use of federal funds. In a statement, Willis did not appear to explicitly say if she will comply with the subpoena. “These false allegations are included in baseless litigation filed by a holdover employee from the previous administration who was terminated for cause,” Willis said in a statement Friday. “The courts that have ruled found no merit in these claims. We expect the same result in any pending litigation.” House Republicans are also investigating unsubstantiated allegations that Willis engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor on the Georgia election subversion case, Nathan Wade, according to a previous letter from Jordan. That letter piggybacked on claims made by former President Donald Trump and two of his co-defendants as part of an effort to get the criminal charges against them in Georgia dismissed and Willis disqualified from the case. Willis has denied Jordan’s previous requests for documents. The original court filing containing the allegations did not provide direct evidence of an improper relationship between Willis and Wade. Neither Wade nor Willis have commented. The DA’s office said they would respond in court filings, facing a Friday deadline. The co-defendant who filed the initial motion, former Trump campaign official Mike Roman, accused Willis of benefitting financially from her alleged relationship with Wade, who allegedly used earnings from the case on vacations they took. Jordan’s previous letter leaned heavily on those accusations and requests that Wade turn over documents and communications House Republicans believe are relevant to their oversight of “politically motivated prosecutions by state and local officials.” Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee have long sought to undermine the credibility of Willis’s case against Trump and more than a dozen co-defendants.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/verdict-trump-new-york-business-fraud-case/index.html,"New York City CNN — New guidance from court officials suggests a verdict in the civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Donald Trump could come any time in the next few weeks. “It’s looking like early to mid-February, as a rough estimate, and subject to modifications,” said Al Baker, a spokesperson for the Office of Court Administration. Judge Arthur Engoron is poised to issue a written ruling on fraud claims against Trump and his co-defendants, which includes his adult sons and his company. The attorney general has said Trump and his company should pay $370 million in disgorgement for their ill-gotten gains. Engoron said at closing arguments for the bench trial that he’d aim to file his ruling on the public docket by January 31, but warned the parties that wasn’t a firm deadline. Last Friday, the court-appointed monitor overseeing Trump Organization business activities filed a report flagging errors and inconsistencies in financial disclosures that Trump’s company submitted to third parties. The monitor warned that the issues may continue if they go unaddressed. “My observations suggest misstatements and errors may continue to occur, which could result in incorrect or inaccurate reporting of financial information to third parties,” Judge Barbara Jones wrote. In a letter response filed Monday, Trump’s attorney said the monitor’s latest report contains factual inaccuracies and is “misleading and disingenuous.” “The January 26 Report, issued mere days before an expected decision, has only two obvious purposes: (1) ensure the Monitor continues to receive exorbitant fees (in excess of $2.6 million to date); and (2) fill the gaping hole in the Attorney General’s case, namely, that there is no basis to support continued oversight,” the response stated. Engoron has already ruled that Trump has engaged in fraud and ordered the dissolution of his business empire, an action that is on hold pending Trump’s appeal. The judge canceled business certificates for many of Trump’s entities in New York, including the Trump Organization – a sprawling entity comprised of 500 limited liability companies. Engoron also called for a receiver to oversee the dissolution of the entities, which include buildings such as Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street and the Seven Springs family compound in Westchester County, New York. His upcoming ruling will address six additional claims including conspiracy, issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and insurance fraud. The former president has cast the case as a political witch hunt. Legally, Trump and his team argue that there’s no proof of an intent to defraud and that lenders were obligated to conduct their own due diligence, regardless of the valuations the Trump Organization supplied. And they say companies like Deutsche Bank wanted to do business with the Trump Organization and went into the deals with open eyes. CNN’s Dan Berman contributed to this report.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/cnn-poll-economy/index.html,"CNN — The public’s long-held pessimism about the economy shows signs of easing since last year, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds. But even with the uptick, many Americans’ views of the economy – and the nation as a whole – remain bleak. Only 35% of Americans say that things in the country today are going well, but that’s an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall. And while just 26% of Americans say they feel the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past few years, that’s also up from 20% last summer and 17% in December 2022. Overall, 26% of Americans currently say that economic conditions have stabilized, and 48% say they believe the economy remains in a downturn. Yet, the US economy has been growing strongly since 2020, and the jobs report released Friday showed a stunning gain of 353,000 jobs last month, a stronger-than expected kickoff for 2024. Story highlights Only 35% of Americans say things in the US are going well now, but that is up from last year. The uptick is coming mainly from Democrats and independents. A majority of Americans feel Biden’s economic policies have worsened conditions. Of those who think the economy is recovering, nearly three-quarters (73%) say President Joe Biden’s economic policies have helped to improve things. An even broader 83% of those who say the economy is continuing to devolve say his policies have instead made things worse. Views of the nation’s economic trajectory are inflected by partisanship, with the uptick in sentiment coming mainly among Democrats (49% now say the economy is recovering, up 10 percentage points from July) and independents (24%, up 7 points). Just 6% of Republicans say they see a recovery beginning, nearly unchanged from last summer. But within the Democratic Party, there’s also a significant age divide, with most younger Democrats less likely to see the economy on the upswing. About one-third of Democrats younger than 45 (35%) say that the economy is starting to recover, compared with 63% of those 45 and older. And more broadly, a narrow majority of Democratic adults younger than 45 (54%) say that things in the country are going badly, a view shared by only about one-quarter of their older counterparts (22%). Recent Commerce Department numbers show the US economy remaining robust, CNN reported in January, with the first jobs report for 2024 expected to look strong. When Americans who say the economy remains in a downturn were asked to explain why they feel that way, most cite inflation and the cost of living generally (50%) or the price of specific items like food (9%) or housing (7%), with many pointing to their own financial situations. Another 13% who feel the economy is still in decline cite Biden or Democratic policies, and 9% name wages and income. Fewer mention jobs, gas prices or the stock market. “Everything that matters in life is continuing to get more expensive, regardless of what the inflation index says,” wrote one Republican from Georgia who responded to the poll. “Everything is still expensive and many people are struggling with that,” said a Republican-leaning independent from Louisiana. “Consumer debt is way up. Wall Street is doing well but that doesn’t help the average worker.” Overall, 42% of all Americans say their financial situation is worse than it was a year ago, down from 49% who felt that way in December of 2022 when the nation’s inflation rate was nearly double what it is today . In the new poll, 37% say they’re doing about the same as a year ago, and 20% that they’re now doing better. A 55% majority of Americans overall say they feel Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions and another 19% say they’ve had no effect – numbers that are nearly unchanged from last summer. A near-universal 91% of Republicans say that Biden’s policies have worsened the economy, while a more modest 55% majority of Democrats say that his policies have improved things. Biden’s approval rating for handling the economy, which hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, currently stands at 37% among the full public. Immigration and foreign policy Biden’s lowest issue approval rating in the poll comes on his handling of immigration, with just 30% of Americans approving. That number reflects heightened concerns about the state of affairs at the US-Mexico border. Asked whether or not the current situation at the border is a crisis, 79% of Americans – including majorities across party lines – say that it is, matching the elevated level of concern last seen in April 2021. And the poll also finds a rise in hardline immigration sentiments. In multiple polls taken during Donald Trump’s presidency, the overwhelming majority of Americans said they favored developing a plan to allow some undocumented immigrants living in the US to become legal residents; in 2019, 15% or fewer said that the government should instead make it a priority to deport all people living in the US illegally. The share favoring mass deportations, while still a minority, has now roughly doubled to 31%. A 54% majority of Republicans now say the US should prioritize deportation, up from 32% who felt that way in 2019. Americans give Biden a 41% approval rating for his handling of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while 34% approve of his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. That disparity highlights the president’s particular weakness with his base on issues relating to Israel. While most Democrats give him positive ratings on Ukraine (72% approve), only about half (51%) say they approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war; among Democrats younger than 45, that falls to just 35%. Overall, a slim plurality (37%) of Americans say that the US is doing about the right amount to help Israel in its war with Hamas, while 33% say it’s doing too much and 29% that the US is doing too little. The public is closely split between saying the US is doing too much (35%) or about the right amount (34%) to help Ukraine in its war with Russia, with 30% saying the US is doing too little to assist there. Partisan views of the two conflicts differ sharply. Republicans are roughly twice as likely as Democrats (40% to 19%) to say that the US is doing too little to help Israel. By contrast, Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans (41% to 21%) to say that the US isn’t doing enough to help Ukraine. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from January 25-30 among a random national sample of 1,212 adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/politics/roberta-kaplan-donald-trump-deposition-maralago/index.html,"CNN — Attorney Roberta Kaplan said former President Donald Trump threw papers across a table and stormed off during a deposition at Mar-a-Lago after learning that his legal team had agreed to provide her lunch. Kaplan, who has represented clients in high-profile cases against Trump, including E. Jean Carroll, said on an episode of the “George Conway Explains it All (to Sarah Longwell)” podcast recorded Thursday that she rejected the former president’s request that they work through a lunch break because he believed the deposition was “a waste of my time.” Roberta Kaplan Kaplan Hecker & Fink “And then you could kind of see the wheel spinning in his brain. You could really almost see it,” Kaplan told Republican strategist Sarah Longwell and conservative attorney George Conway, a longtime Trump critic. “And he said, ‘Well, you’re here in Mar-a-Lago. What do you think you’re going to do for lunch? Where are you going to get lunch?’” Kaplan said she told him that his attorneys had “graciously offered to provide” her team with lunch — a common civil practice between opposing legal teams. “At which point there was a huge pile of documents, exhibits, sitting in front of him, and he took the pile and he just threw it across the table. And stormed out of the room,” Kaplan shared, adding that Trump specifically yelled at his lawyer Alina Habba for providing them lunch. “He really yelled at Alina for that. He was so mad at Alina,” she said. Kaplan continued: “He came back in and he said, ‘Well, how’d you like the lunch?’ And I said, ‘Well, sir, I had a banana. You know, I can never really eat when I’m taking testimony.’ And he said, ‘Well, I told you,’ — it was kind of charming. He said, ‘I told you, I told them to make you really bad sandwiches, but they can’t help themselves here. We have the best sandwiches.’” Kaplan was deposing Trump at Mar-Lago in a lawsuit alleging the former president was involved with a fraudulent marketing company. A federal judge dismissed the suit last month. In a separate anecdote, Kaplan detailed the end of the deposition when she was set to leave, saying that Trump told her: “See you next Tuesday” – a phrase that is often used as a derogatory euphemism directed at women. “We come in the room and I say, ‘I’m done asking questions’ and immediately I hear from the other side, ‘Off the record. Off the record. Off the record.’ So they must have planned it. And he looks at me from across the table and he says, ‘See you next Tuesday,’” she recounted. Kaplan said that she was initially confused, as their next meeting was set for a Wednesday. “You could tell it was like, it was like a kind of a joke again, like teenage boys would come up with. But again, I wasn’t in on the joke,” she said. “I wasn’t in on the joke, so I had no idea. Then we get into the car and my colleagues are like, ‘Robbie, do you know what that means?’ And I’m like, ‘No, what are you talking about?’ They tell me and I’m like, oh my God, thank God I didn’t know because had I known, I for sure would have gotten angry. There’s no question I would have gotten angry,” Kaplan said. CNN has reached out to representatives for Trump and Habba. Kaplan’s comments come a week after her victory in Carroll’s defamation trial against Trump. A jury awarded Carroll — a former magazine columnist who has alleged Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her when he denied her claim — $83.3 million. Trump is expected to appeal the verdict. E. Jean Carroll and attorney Roberta Kaplan (R) is seen leaving Manhattan Federal Court on January 26, 2024 in New York City. GWR/Star Max/Getty Images Kaplan also described last week’s verdict as a career-defining moment. When asked which feels better — winning the defamation case against Trump or her successful challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013 that led to the eventual Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for same-sex marriage — Kaplan pointed to her recent victory. “I spent my whole life devoted to the principle that we have a rule of law and we have a judicial system that works,” Kaplan said. “And that’s what makes us a constitutional democracy, that’s — at least until recently — was to be admired worldwide. And it was starting, I mean, it is in times looking like that may not be true.” But, she added: “This case validated that at least as of now, we still have all that.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/biden-coalition-election-trump/index.html,"Detroit CNN — Rev. Charles Williams is among those warily bracing for a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump . This time around, he believes at least one thing is different: Biden can’t win through voters’ fear of Trump alone. “We saw something that scared us all, but here we are now, four years after that,” said Williams, the pastor of Historic King Solomon Baptist Church. “You realize, maybe this guy ain’t the boogeyman.” Williams, who had a front-row seat to the soaring Black voter turnout in Detroit that helped propel Biden to victory in Michigan in 2020, said he believes exhaustion at the prospect of another Biden-Trump contest could complicate efforts to generate enthusiasm among young voters. “The challenge that Joe Biden has is that he speaks to an entirely different generation,” Williams said. “He speaks to the greatest generation. He speaks very well to the baby boomers, but he does not speak to a generation that had a president that listened to Jay-Z on his playlist.” President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump AP, Getty Images Related article CNN Poll: Trump narrowly leads Biden in general election rematch Four years ago, Biden built a diverse coalition of supporters – from all ages and races – to win the White House. But whether that vast, fraying network can be rebuilt will help determine whether Trump returns to power. Here in Michigan, which the president visited Thursday , rests one of the biggest tests of his campaign. Trump narrowly carried the state over Hillary Clinton in 2016 – by 10,704 votes – and four years later Biden defeated Trump by about 154,000 votes. Michigan, along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which the president also flipped in 2020, is a part of Biden’s “blue wall” around America’s Great Lakes, which will be just as essential this year to his chance of winning a second term. Dearborn distrust and discontent Biden’s challenges are complicated by deep anger and distrust among Muslim and Arab Americans over the Israel-Hamas war . The searing discontent, which has played out in relentless protests of the president in recent weeks, threatens to undermine one piece of the Biden coalition. “He’s just not somebody that I can trust,” said Adam Abusalah, who worked as a field organizer for the Biden campaign four years ago, focusing on Arab American voters in Michigan. Today, Abusalah said that he and many of those voters will not support Biden because they believe his administration is complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 8: A woman holds a sign suggesting that she might now vote for Donald Trump for president as protesters march in the street to denounce the Biden administration's support of Israel, which has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians so far in its war against Hamas in Gaza, on December 8, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden plan to attend six fundraising events and meetings between them in the Los Angeles area over the weekend. More than 17,487 Palestinians, including more than 6,600 children, are reported to have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel, killing approximately 1,200 on October 7. After a several day cease fire to exchange hostages and prisoners, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have resumed its bombing and ground fighting, now intensifying in southern Gaza after weeks of warning people to flee there to escape Israeli bombing in the north.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) David McNew/Getty Images Related article Biden’s Gaza problems are deeper than just being interrupted in public Asked whether he feared withholding support from Biden could help Trump win, Abusalah replied: “It probably will.” “They’re telling us that as Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, as minority communities who are not supporting Biden, that we are the reason we are going to get another four years of Donald Trump,” Abusalah said. “But the reality is, Joe Biden is the reason that we’re going to get another four years of Donald Trump.” In the Michigan primary on February 27, Abusalah and other community leaders are urging voters to select “uncommitted” instead of Biden on the ballot. Signs declaring “ Abandon Biden ” were passed out at a rally on the eve of the president’s visit this week. The Biden campaign selected a closed-door union training hall in Warren, located north of Detroit in Macomb County, for the president’s carefully choreographed trip on Thursday that also included an impromptu stop at a restaurant. He did not go near Dearborn , which is home to the largest per capita Muslim population in the United States. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators gather in Warren, Michigan, on February 1, 2024, outside the venue where President Joe Biden was speaking. Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that the administration would send officials to Michigan this month “to hear directly from community leaders on a range of issues that are important to them and their families, including the conflict in Israel and Gaza.” A campaign spokesman said Biden would fight for support from Michigan voters. “President Biden won in 2020 by mobilizing a broad and diverse coalition of voters and fighting for the issues that matter most to them: their rights, their pocketbooks, and our democracy,” spokesman Kevin Munoz told CNN. “The president’s campaign is working hard to not ask, but earn the support of the voters who will decide this election.” Bridge to the future It was nearly four years ago, on the eve of a Michigan primary that helped Biden all but seal the Democratic nomination, when he presented himself as a bridge to the party’s future appearing onstage with Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Biden said over booming applause in the gymnasium at Renaissance High School in Detroit. “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.” The unspoken message, at least at the time, was that Biden might only serve one term.

I think it comes from him being the oldest president and people kind of treat him – I don’t want to say as a joke – but they don’t have respect for him as much as they’ve had for other presidents.” Dante Parker, a fellow student, said he would study the race, including third-party candidates, before reaching a decision this fall. He said a vote for Biden is hardly guaranteed. “I’m a free thinker. I like to think outside the box,” Parker said. “We’ve been stuck in this system for far too long, maybe it’s time we venture outside of it to make some progress now.” Second-term plans Norman Clement, the founder of the nonprofit Detroit Change Initiative, said rebuilding the Biden coalition starts with fighting significant misinformation , particularly among younger voters, about what the president has done or tried to do. But, he said, the burden was on Biden and his campaign to spell out what he would do in a second term. “We’re not happy with Biden,” Clement said, recalling a frequent refrain he hears from voters. “But we understand the other option is not an option that’s favorable to us.” He said he often hears complaints about promises that Biden hasn’t been able to achieve, including voting rights reform, policing reform and more, but the reasons why aren’t as well known, such as the narrow majorities in Congress or, in the case of student debt forgiveness, the Supreme Court blocking the Biden administration’s plan . Asked whether he was more worried about people backing Trump or young people not voting at all, Clement said: “I’m worried about the protest vote.” “A protest vote is that I’m not voting for either candidate,” he said. “There’s such a notion on social media, ‘Hold my vote, hold my vote.’ My message to them is that we did that in 2016, we held our vote, and folks didn’t come out.”"
cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/lawyers-prepare-supreme-court-arguments-trump-ballot-case/index.html,"CNN — Lawyer Jason Murray, taking the lead next week in the Supreme Court battle to keep Donald Trump off presidential ballots , has never argued before the justices. Jonathan Mitchell , representing Trump, is a well-known conservative advocate with some experience at the court – yet none in a case close to this magnitude. As of Friday, both men will move their operations to Washington and tap into a sophisticated network of lawyers who’ve stood many times in the well of the courtroom and are positioned to channel the justices. Murray and Mitchell will engage in multiple “moot courts,” separately honing their cases before attorneys who fire questions designed to simulate the justices and their intensity. Story highlights The two lawyers going head-to-head in the battle to keep Donald Trump off presidential ballots have respective fortes Questions from the nine justices can have little to do with the lawyer at the lectern. Moot courts can ferociously test a lawyer Such sessions are designed to expose the weaknesses in a case, devise solutions and refine its strong points. The tougher the moot – the adage goes – the smoother the actual argument. During any given session at the real venue, a lawyer will be pummeled with questions from the nine justices on everything from tiny details in the trial record to broad scenarios regarding the consequences of a potential ruling. Some of these scenarios can be wildly outlandish, and the strongest advocates field the myriad while continually turning the court back to core legal points that reinforce their case. “It’s an extraordinary lift for an advocate to master the historical and constitutional materials raised in this case,” said David Frederick, who has argued 59 times at the court and written a book on advocacy. “But the hardest part,” Frederick said of the Trump case, “is anticipating the many hypotheticals the justices will raise to determine where to draw the proper line. The justices will be mindful that wherever they draw the line, partisans on both sides may seek to use it for future political gain.” Some questioning from the bench can have little to do with the lawyer at the lectern. Justices might use queries to signal their own stands and engage in subtle advocacy ahead of the vote in their private session. For his part, Chief Justice John Roberts may pose a question that reframes the issue and suddenly extinguishes any assumptions of his thinking. Advocates are advised to especially heed Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh who are at the ideological center of the bench and can steer the outcome of close cases. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan and conservative Justice Samuel Alito , meanwhile, can trip up the most experienced advocates with their hypothetical questions. They have a way of targeting the weakest spot. Despite the solemn grandeur of the Supreme Court setting, arguments are often free-for-alls. There can be interruptions and crosstalk among justices. Lawyers can never be sure what element of a case someone might latch onto, perhaps consequential, perhaps in the end irrelevant. This case of Trump v. Anderson is particularly difficult because of the multitude concerns arising from the open-ended 14th Amendment section barring certain officials who engaged in an insurrection from holding future office. Jason Murray during a hearing on November 3, in Denver. Jack Dempsey/Pool/AP Jonathan Mitchell during a panel in April 2016. From C-SPAN Murray, representing the Colorado voters trying to exclude Trump from the state ballot, has four moots planned. Mitchell, on behalf of Trump, has two arranged. Sources familiar with their schedules say both men will appear at the Georgetown Law School’s Supreme Court Institute, with its courtroom that replicates the crimson drapes and other trappings of the real setting. They will have separate, closed-door sessions at the place that has become a national leader in moots for attorneys preparing for a Supreme court appearance. Preparing for Thursday’s arguments, Murray and Mitchell face a herculean challenge with this dispute that involves multiple constitutional issues and strikes at the core of electoral politics and democracy. It also brings the court back to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, across from its own columned structure. All deadlines for the lawyers’ filings and oral arguments were dramatically compressed, as the justices positioned themselves to try to decide the case before most of the state presidential primaries. Lawyers typically have several months to prepare. Other cases that were granted hearings in early January, as Trump v. Anderson was, will not be heard until late April or even next fall. And, adding to the pressure, every word the men speak will be parsed in real time. Many media outlets, including CNN, will be carrying the session live. Preparing with moot courts Although lacking experience before these nine justices, Murray and Mitchell have their respective fortes. Murray is a veteran of appellate courts and argued the challenge to Trump in Colorado that ended with a state supreme court decision disqualifying him from the state ballot. Mitchell joined the case on behalf of Trump around the time arguments were underway at the Colorado Supreme Court. Mitchell, however, is a strategic conservative thinker in sync with the right-wing of this bench . They each have thrived in different professional realms. Murray was a trial lawyer for 11 years with the national corporate law firm Bartlit Beck, handling big-dollar commercial disputes. Last year, Murray left the firm to join former colleagues in a new Colorado-based boutique firm of Olson Grimsley. The six-lawyer firm said its aim was groundbreaking public interest litigation. Mitchell, meanwhile, has been attracted to ideologically and politically charged cases, serving as solicitor general of Texas for five years and teaching at various law schools before establishing his own one-person firm in 2018. Mitchell previously argued five cases at the high court, including in 2021 to support a Texas abortion ban. Three weeks after the Trump case, Mitchell will be back before the justices, representing a gun owner challenging a federal ban on bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire more rapidly, potentially hundreds of bullets a minute. The Supreme Court typically allots one hour for each case, 30 minutes per side. But because of the justices’ protracted questioning, the sessions regularly go about twice as long. Moot courts – ferociously testing a lawyer – tend to go even longer. At the same time, there are limits to replicating the real thing. Rather than nine moot “justices,” many advocates say the ideal for a moot is four or five on the panel. Any more along a makeshift bench, and the practice session grows too chaotic. Organizers of a moot, whether a law school, public-interest entity, or simply a small group of legal partners, naturally try to enlist lawyers who have argued many times before the justices and understand their points of persuasion. Georgetown’s Supreme Court Institute, for instance, relies heavily on attorneys who have served in the US solicitor general’s office, the government’s top lawyers before the Supreme Court. The Institute usually conducts a confidential moot for just one side, on a first-come, first-served basis. (If both sides come in within 48 hours, there’s a coin toss.) In a handful of cases of major significance, the Institute will hold moot courts for both sides, but only if both sets of parties agree to the arrangement. (The Institute, which operates on a non-partisan basis and offers its sessions for free, declined to comment on the Trump case arrangement.) Particularly valuable for any moot court, along with former members of the solicitor general’s office, are former Supreme Court law clerks. They were once in a position to help prepare justices for arguments and then assist in the writing of decisions. Both Murray and Mitchell have such experience. A Harvard law graduate, Murray served as a law clerk to two of the justices: Kagan and Neil Gorsuch, when he was on the Denver-based 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Joining Murray at the counsel table on Thursday will be Eric Olson and Sean Grimsely, also former Supreme Court law clerks who have been involved in the Colorado case from the start. Mitchell, a graduate of the University of Chicago, was a law clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Mitchell is well-known to all the current bench for devising the Texas abortion ban that led to the Supreme Court’s eventual 5-4 vote reversing Roe v. Wade. Kagan, a dissenter in that 2022 case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization , also dissented in the 2021 Texas case but not before referring disparagingly during oral arguments to the Texas ban masterminds as “some geniuses” who figured out a way to evade the Constitution. In that November 2021 controversy, the Supreme Court allowed Mitchell 10 minutes as an an intervenor on the Texas side. His time at the lectern came after four other sets of arguments more central to the dispute were heard. Next week, Mitchell and Murray will hold the leading roles. They may be allotted only the usual 30 minutes per side, or the justices may expand the number of minutes scheduled for each. No matter the allotment, if past oral arguments are any guide, Murray and Mitchell will be in the courtroom for hours and longer than imagined."

President Biden holds a campaign event in Nevada Sunday, two days ahead of the crucial western battleground state's presidential primary. Biden's stop this weekend in Las Vegas comes a day after he quickly cruised to a landslide victory in South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary and scored his second straight convincing win in his party's 2024 nominating calendar. The president, moving toward an all-but-certain nomination, on Saturday grabbed roughly 96% of the vote in the Palmetto State as ballots continued to be counted into the night. ""In 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign and set us on the path to winning the presidency,"" Biden said in a statement soon after the race was called.

(AP Photo/Artie Walker Jr.) ""Now, in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again, and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again — and making Donald Trump a loser — again."" Biden trounced his two long-shot Democratic primary challengers , Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and Marianne Williamson, the bestselling author and spiritual adviser who's making her second straight White House run. A week and a half earlier, the president wasn't on the ballot in New Hampshire because the state's Democrats held a primary in violation of the Democratic National Committee's 2024 nominating calendar. But he still won 64% of the vote, thanks to a well-funded write-in effort by top Granite State Democrats. No delegates were up for grabs in New Hampshire's unsanctioned primary, but 55 were at stake in South Carolina's primary, with Biden expected to win all of them. South Carolina, where Black voters play an outsize role in state Democratic politics, for the first time led off the party's official presidential nominating calendar. And much of the credit goes to Biden , who orchestrated an upending of the Democratic National Committee's long-running nominating calendar to place the Palmetto State first. For Biden, there was a bigger mission this weekend in South Carolina than just winning the primary and collecting delegates.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The president is aiming to solidify his support among Black voters in South Carolina and across the country. Those voters, who four years ago boosted Biden first to the Democratic nomination and ultimately into the White House, appear less energized in 2024. The president's approval ratings among Black voters, who are a crucial part of the Democratic Party base, have eroded over the past three years, which is a significant concern for his re-election chances. DNC CHAIR TELLS NIKKI HALEY SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATS ‘ARE NOT BAILING YOU OUT’ And while Black voters overwhelmingly cast ballots for Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans made gains . Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for this year's Republican nomination, is making a play for Black and Hispanic voters. Trump often points to endorsements from Black celebrities as a sign of his support in the Black community. And Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, a former 2024 GOP White House candidate and the only Black Republican in the Senate who endorsed Trump last month, has become a top surrogate for the former president.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) While Trump suggests ""there is much more enthusiasm now"" for him among minority voters, there's little polling evidence to back up his claims. But even a slight shift of voters from Biden to Trump — or the possibility of some Black voters frustrated with a lack of progress on key issues sitting out the 2024 election — could potentially make the difference in crucial battleground states like Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that Biden narrowly won in 2020. Black voters carried Biden to a landslide victory in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary four years ago, igniting his 2020 campaign after earlier setbacks.

The president enjoys the backing of the DNC as he seeks a second term in the White House, and national party chair Jaime Harrison, back in his home state, told Fox News Digital on Saturday morning in Columbia, South Carolina, that ""this president wanted to send a signal to Black folks, not only here in South Carolina, but across the nation, that we see you, we hear you and you matter. ""That is why it's important for the president and the vice president and the first lady and the second gentleman to come into a state and to show up even when they know that they're going to win . And that they're going to win decisively."" Turnout in South Carolina's Democratic primary was roughly a quarter of what it was four years ago, when there was a wide open and competitive primary. But the Biden campaign spotlighted that Black voters made up three-quarters of the electorate, up 20 points from 2020. Biden was in California for meetings and campaign fundraisers as the results were tabulated in South Carolina. But he called into a South Carolina Democratic Party celebration after the race was called. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""What happened?"" he joked on the call. ""I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. And you're not rid of me. I'm coming back."" Next up is Nevada, where 36 delegates are up for grabs in Tuesday's Democratic primary. While Biden and Williamson are on the ballot in the Silver State, Phillips is not since he declared his candidacy for president in late October, after the state's filing deadline had passed. Spanish-speaking voters, with whom Republicans have also made gains, play an influential role in Nevada elections. In a strange twist, there are two Republican presidential nominating contests in Nevada. A GOP primary will also be held Tuesday and a Republican caucus on Thursday. In 2021, when Democrats controlled Nevada's governor's office and legislature, the state switched from running caucuses to a state-run primary. But the state GOP objected and eventually decided to hold caucuses. No delegates will be at stake in the primary, while all 26 will be up for grabs in the caucus. Former President Trump is the only remaining major candidate running in the caucus, while former U.N. Ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the sole major GOP contender on the primary ballot. Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.

""China is pursuing AI, but they're also pursuing quantum computing, and it’s a lethal combination,"" Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital. ""And in terms of artificial intelligence, the more data that they gather, the faster they’ll advance…AI is a race that we need to win."" Gimenez explained that AI technology was rapidly being integrated into more facets of both everyday life and the national security sphere.

So it's important for us to win that race, or else that technology will be used against us in the future,"" he said. When asked about his concerns regarding China coming out ahead, Gimenez said, ""Many of their weapons will be superior to ours, and that causes me great concern."" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Just last year, the Pentagon unveiled an ambitious new AI program, called the Replicator initiative , aimed at producing thousands of drones with autonomous capabilities in order to compete with China. ""Replicator is meant to help us overcome the PRC’s biggest advantage, which is mass. More ships. More missiles. More people,"" Deputy Pentagon Secretary Kathleen Hicks said in August. ""To stay ahead, we’re going to create a new state of the art — just as America has before — leveraging attritable, autonomous systems in all domains — which are less expensive, put fewer people in the line of fire, and can be changed, updated, or improved with substantially shorter lead times."" Rep. Carlos Gimenez, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Getty Images) However, Gimenez pointed out that in addition to the military implications, the AI race between the U.S. and China is also being run on a more granular level, which is aided by Beijing’s ability to harvest Americans’ data via TikTok. He pressed FBI Director Christopher Wray on the issue in a hearing last month, during which Wray admitted he had ""very significant security concerns about TikTok."" ISRAEL CREATES AI PLATFORM TO TRACK THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN GAZA ""It’s a combination of the ability that the Chinese government would have, if they should choose to exercise it, to control the collection of the data, to control the recommendation algorithm, and if they wanted to, to be able to control and compromise devices,"" Wray said. ""And if you layer AI, as you’re saying, on top of all of that, it just amplifies those concerns, because the ability to use U.S. personal data and feed that into their AI engine, that just magnifies the problem."" Gimenez told Fox News Digital that the way to mitigate concerns about China and stay on top of AI innovation was to look closely at U.S. institutions with ties to Beijing.

So, yeah, that experience, it takes me to this whole other level of thought, you know, thinking if they're really going to allow men to go in there and box with women. That is just deadly."" Williams said she never thought in a ""million years"" she would one day be talking about men being allowed to fight against women. ""We’re living in crazy times right now,"" Williams said. ""There's just no way that a man should be able to come into a boxing ring and box with a woman,"" Williams added. ""No matter what, if they're born a man, then they're a man. Doesn't matter if they have gone through transition. ""I think most of the people that I have communicated with feel the same way. But a lot are worried to speak out. You know, we live in a weird cancel culture, and so I think a lot of people don't want to voice their opinions on it, which is really sad because we need more people to stand up on this ."" Williams says she has been ""racking my brain"" to understand why USA Boxing made this decision despite the Association of Ringside Physicians issuing a statement opposing transgender females in boxing based on the science. She told Fox News Digital the move will be a barrier to women getting into boxing. THE FUTURE OF WOMEN'S SPORTS IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF TRANSGENDER ATHLETES ""This is going to be a huge barrier for the young women coming up, the young girls coming up in the sport of boxing, because, first of all, boxing is a very challenging sport. Actually, ESPN did a study. It is the toughest sport out of all sports,"" Williams said. ""So, you look at that, and obviously you can get hurt. It's a little painful when you get hit, so you already know there's a lot of girls that aren't necessarily interested in getting into it. But once they do, they've overcome that part of it. Now, you're adding this layer of, ‘Oh, now you might have to box a boy or a man.’ You put that in front of them, and they're going to say, 'Well, then I don't want a box.' "" Cary Williams (Cary Williams) Williams acknowledged many athletes who speak out against transgender competition in sports have been maligned as ""bigots"" or ""transphobic"" but stressed the importance of recognizing ""reality and science."" "" For individuals to be emotional and base things off of ideology instead of, you know, actual reality and science, It's beyond my belief,"" Williams said. ""I can't really comprehend what goes through their minds. But I'll tell you what, if they're going to say that I'm this, that or the other thing, the issue is if somebody decides that they want to transition, a man wants to transition to be a woman, that is a big decision in life, and they can make that decision. ""But when they make that decision, there are consequences that come with that decision. And one of them is that they cannot compete as a woman in the sport of boxing or any other sport. They have to take that into account when they make that decision in their life. I think that is only fair. So, again, it's just we all make choices in life, and there are consequences of the choices that we make."" Williams said if biological men continue to be allowed in women’s sports ""we’re all going to be in trouble,"" and it will erase decades of work women have done to establish their right to compete on the big stage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Women are going to lose their space,"" Williams said. ""Women, we have had to work really, really hard and for a very long time to have our space in the sport. A very long time. Why can't transgender athletes do the same thing? You know what? They can create their own space, but it takes time. You can't just go, 'Oh, I'm transgender. I want to box women.' That is unfair as well. You know, there are a lot of different layers to this."" USA Boxing responded to a request for comment from Fox News Digital by pointing to a letter it sent to membership explaining its transgender policy. ""The policy for USA Boxing provides a pathway for transgender athletes (gender identity or gender expression) to compete only if and when the most advanced stages of transition are completed and documented,"" the letter says. ""This means the athlete must be older than 18, they must have completed full surgical reassignment and gone through multiple years of hormone therapy, with four years of hormone testing proving their levels are within acceptable ranges according to the policy.""

He pointed to the decision to remove former President Trump from the ballot as an example of how the state has gone overboard attacking democracy. Maine GOP State Rep.

Stewart says the bill, LD 1735, would have allowed ""for a non-parental custodian to take a child in Maine for the purposes of sex change, surgery and other procedures, without the parents' consent."" ""It was a carryover bill from last year, garnered a ton of national headlines and opposition and, thankfully, because of that, I believe, we were able to push back in committee on that and put a spotlight on it,"" Stewart said.

The complaint, filed by America First Legal (AFL), alleges that Hunter engaged in a pattern and practice of professional misconduct, violating the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct 8.4, which the group says raises ""substantial questions as to his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer.""

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-releases-long-awaited-border-legislation,"close Video GOP divided over support for bipartisan border deal Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the congressional battle over an immigration and border security deal. Senate negotiators on Sunday released the text of the much-anticipated border deal that lawmakers have been hashing out with White House officials since December, incorporating significant reforms, including a crackdown on asylum and parole. Talks have been ongoing for months as a bipartisan group of lawmakers — Sens. James Lankford, Krysten Sinema, and Chris Murphy — have tried to strike a deal with White House officials to fix the crisis at the southern border. The deal would be included in supplemental spending that includes billions in foreign assistance to Ukraine and Israel. BORDER DEAL PRICE TAG LIKELY TO COST MORE THAN $14 BILLION, BUT GOP LAWMAKERS GROW RESTLESS TO SEE BILL TEXT Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., conducts a news conference after the senate luncheons in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, June 21, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The agreement holds the potential to allocate $60 billion to Ukraine and $14 billion to Israel, yet its passage through the House appears doubtful. House Republicans have deemed the bill a non-starter unless it incorporates essential components from H.R.2, the House GOP border bill. With Senate Democrats dismissing H.R.2, tensions persist. Meanwhile, Johnson vowed to put $17.6 billion in emergency funding on the House floor next week to give Israel assistance. In the Biden administration's original supplemental request, officials sought over $100 billion in funding, including $14 billion for the border. But Republicans demanded limits on migrant releases into the interior, including the use of parole, and negotiators have been attempting to find a compromise. ""While the Senate appears poised to finally release the text of their supplemental package after months of behind-closed-doors negotiations, their leadership is aware that by failing to include the House in their negotiations, they have eliminated the ability for swift consideration of any legislation,"" Johnson said.

(Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) Sunday's proposed legislation will total just over $118 billion, with 50,000 new visas. The border proposal, which took months to negotiate, is aimed at gaining control of an asylum system that has been overwhelmed by historic numbers of migrants coming to the border. The bill proposes an overhaul to the system with tougher and quicker enforcement measures. UNITED STATES -January 5: Migrants line up outside a migrant re-ticketing center at St. Brigid School on E. 7th St. Friday, Jan. 5, 2024 in Manhattan. (Barry Williams for NY Daily News via Getty Images) If the number of illegal border crossings reaches above 5,000 daily for a five-day average, an expulsion authority would automatically kick in so that migrants are sent back to Mexico without an opportunity to make an asylum claim. If the number reaches 4,000, presidential administrations would have the option of using the expulsion authority. Biden, referencing the authority, has said he would use it to ""shut down the border"" as soon as the bill is signed into law. The bill would allot $20 billion to immigration enforcement, including the hiring of thousands of new officers to evaluate asylum claims, as well as hundreds of Border Patrol agents. Some of that money would go to shelters and services in cities across the U.S. that have struggled to keep up with the influx of migrants in recent months. Migrants who seek asylum, which provides protection for people facing persecution in their home countries, would face a tougher and faster process to having their claim evaluated. The standard in initial interviews, known as credible fear screenings, would be raised, and many would receive those interviews within days of arriving at the border. Final decisions on their asylum claims would happen within months, rather than the often years-long wait that happens now. ‘BIDENOMICS’ FALLS FLAT WITH VOTERS AS TRUMP TAKES HUGE LEAD IN NEW POLL On the agreement, President Biden said there ""is more work to be done to get it over the finish line."" ""I want to be clear about something: If you believe, as I do, that we must secure the border now, doing nothing is not an option. Working with my administration, the United States Senate has done the hard work it takes to reach a bipartisan agreement,"" Biden said.

I’m ready to solve the problem. I’m ready to secure the border. And so are the American people."" Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said the bipartisan border security package ""fixes"" the border crisis. ""Now, senators must make a decision: pass our package and solve the crisis or accept the status quo, do nothing, and keep playing politics while our system breaks and our communities continue to suffer,"" Sinema said. ""I choose to secure the border, protect Arizona border communities, fix our broken system, and finally solve the border crisis."" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said Americans were ""tired of the chaos and abuse at our border."" ""I am happy to announce, we have finally finished strong bill text to add to the supplemental funding bill. Though most members of the Senate have already been briefed on the contents of the bill, the final text will be distributed to members of the Senate soon and posted online within a day."" TRUMP TEASES POSSIBLE RALLY AT NEW YORK CITY VENUES, PREDICTS MIGRANT CRISIS COULD SWAY DEMOCRAT VOTERS Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell blamed the border crisis on the Biden administration.

Jeff Van Drew, R-NJ., weighs in on growing Middle East tensions amid attacks from Iranian-led proxies on 'Fox Report.' National security adviser Jake Sullivan declined to rule out U.S. strikes inside Iran on Sunday, while still insisting President Biden is ""not looking to get into a war"" in the Middle East. Sullivan appeared on Sunday programs on CNN, ABC and NBC days after the United States and the United Kingdom began launching a massive airstrike campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Friday as part of retaliation for the killing of three U.S. service members and the injuring of more than 40 others in Jordan along the Syrian border. ""The president has approached this with a straightforward principle, which is that the United States will step up and respond when our forces are attacked. And the United States also is not looking for a wider war in the Middle East. We are not looking to take the United States to war. So we are going to continue to pursue a policy that goes down both of those lines simultaneously, that responds with force and clarity, as we did on Friday night, but also that continues to hew to an approach that does not get the United States pulled into a war, that we have seen too frequently in the Middle East,"" Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" Sullivan vowed ""further action,"" but said he would refrain from telegraphing the United States' punches in the conflict. US AND BRITAIN CARRYING OUT NEW AIRSTRIKES AGAINST HOUTHIS National security adviser Jake Sullivan addresses the World Economic Forum in Davos, on Jan. 16, 2024. (Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images) ""Inside Iran? Would you rule that out at this point?"" Bash asked. ""Look, sitting on a national TV program, I'm not going to rule in and rule out any activity anywhere. What I am going to say is that the president will do what he thinks needs to be done and again, reinforce the point that he's going to defend our forces, and also that he is not looking to get into a war,"" Sullivan said. Bash noted Republican criticism that the Biden administration should have responded before the three U.S. casualties given there have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. troops since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. ""We have responded multiple times, before the tragic events of a few days ago. We have struck targets in both Iraq and Syria,"" Sullivan said. ""We have gone against IRGC and militia-linked facilities in both Iraq and Syria. We have taken out a militia leader in Iraq. So the notion that we have not responded is just incorrect. Second point I would make, is that I didn't hear these same voices, which to me sound mostly like political voices, saying that when American service members were tragically killed by these same militias in the previous administration. This is a challenging, difficult issue. It has been for every president over the past 20 years, and every president has sought to defend American forces."" Iran, meanwhile, issued a warning Sunday to the U.S. over potentially targeting two cargo ships in the Middle East, the Behshad and Saviz, long suspected of serving as a forwarding operating base for Iranian commandos, signaling Tehran's growing unease over the U.S. strikes in recent days in Iraq, Syria and Yemen targeting militias backed by the Islamic Republic. Appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" Sullivan said ""the central purpose of the strikes has been to take away capabilities from the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria that are attacking our forces, and from the Houthis that continue to threaten Red Sea shipping, and we believe they had good effect in reducing degrading the capabilities of the militias and of the Houthis.""

""Some of those steps will be seen, some may not be seen, but there will be more action taken to respond to the death and the tragic death of the three brave U.S. service members. And we cannot rule out that there will be further attacks from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, or from the Houthis. We have to be clear-eyed about that. And the president, in being clear-eyed about that, has told his military commanders that they need to be positioned to respond to further attacks as well."" Sullivan, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also responded to criticism from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who has contended Biden's administration has been appeasing Iran.

(Ameer Al-Mohammedawi/picture alliance via Getty Images) ""I find it somewhat strange.

""So Iran and its militia groups knew that the United States was going to respond. We think that those strikes had good effects.

FIRST ON FOX: Democrats have started the election year off on a high note with a vast fundraising advantage over their Republican counterparts, who are facing a shortage of cash and party disarray in crucial swing states. According to year-end reports filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) this week, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) holds nearly three times the cash on hand reported by the Republican National Committee (RNC), and brought in nearly three times as much fundraising in the final month of 2023. The RNC reported its worst fundraising year since 2013 raising just $87.2 million in 2023, and starting 2024 with just over $8 million in cash on hand. If adjusted for inflation, the RNC's fundraising was last this low in 1993 — before the 2002 McCain Feingold Act restricted political committee fundraising from corporations and capped donations from individuals.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The DNC reported $120 million raised in 2023, and a record $21 million in cash on hand, marking a massive $13 million gap between the two committees. It also reported raising $14.7 million in December to the RNC's $5.3 million. Although the RNC brought in more direct contributions than the DNC throughout the year, the latter enjoys a joint fundraising agreement with incumbent President Biden's re-election campaign, as well as its other joint fundraising committees, and overall outpaced the RNC, which does not have a joint fundraising agreement, for much of that period. National committees of either party often see a decline in fundraising during election cycles against an incumbent president of the opposite party. Republicans are also dealing with disarray in a number of their party organizations in multiple swing states that will be crucial to the party maintaining, or growing, its majority in the House, winning a majority in the Senate and retaking the White House.

The state party also struggled financially throughout last year amid lower contribution levels and hundreds of thousands in legal costs related to the 2020 presidential election. The Democratic National Committee started the election year with $21 million in cash on hand compared to the Republican National Committee's $8 million.

In Nevada, Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald was indicted in a similar fake electors scheme, and in North Carolina, the state Republican Party's FEC report shows that it burned through cash and is now $72,000 in debt. DISPUTED TRUMP-BACKED MICHIGAN GOP CHAIRMAN INVESTED THOUSANDS IN COMPANY DISPOSING ABORTED FETAL REMAINS Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on advertising by Republican presidential candidates in an effort to secure the party's nomination, delaying an opportunity for the party to coalesce around a single candidate and focus on the general election.

The White House stressed Friday evening that the United States is ""not looking for a war with Iran,"" saying the retaliatory strikes carried out in Syria and Iraq were designed to ""de-escalate"" tensions and ""put an end"" to attacks on U.S. troops in the region. The United States began retaliatory strikes on more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militia groups and proxies.

White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby stressed that the United States is not seeking conflict with Iran or in the Middle East, but explained that the strikes that began Friday evening ""will not end"" tonight. Kirby said the targets were carefully selected to avoid civilian casualties and based on irrefutable evidence they were connected to attacks on U.S. troops in the region, adding that the Iraqi government was informed before the strikes were launched. Kirby and Lt. Gen. Douglas A.

""If you are taking away capability of an adversary who is trying to kill your troops and act against your interest in the region—if you are trying to take away their capability then, you are, by default, working to de-escalate tensions and that is our approach here,"" Kirby explained.

(Getty Images) A federal appeals court is considering Trump’s claim of presidential immunity from prosecution for his actions in office. A ruling from that court is expected, and the Supreme Court may eventually review the issue. The delay comes after Smith in December asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether Trump can be prosecuted on charges relating to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Additionally, lawyers for Trump filed a motion urging Chutkan to pause proceedings against Trump in the Jan. 6 case while his appeal is pending. Chutkan said in December that she does not have jurisdiction over the matter while it is pending before the Supreme Court, and she put a pause on the case against the Republican 2024 front-runner until the high court determines its involvement. Smith charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights. Those charges stemmed from Smith’s investigation into whether Trump was involved in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and any alleged interference in the 2020 election result. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August 2023. Brooke Singman is a political correspondent and reporter for Fox News Digital, Fox News Channel and FOX Business."

(JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) Hometown Hero Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley continues to trail former President Donald Trump by a wide margin in her home state of South Carolina ahead of the state's GOP presidential primary later this month, according to a new survey. Of the potential Republican primary voters who were surveyed, 58% said they currently support Trump , compared to 32% who said the same for Haley. Ever since the presidential contest became a two-person race, both Trump and Haley have witnessed an uptick in support. A similar Monmouth University poll released in September showed Trump with 46% support and Haley with 18% support among South Carolina Republicans. Haley has said a couple of times in recent days that she doesn't need to win her home state's GOP primary, she just needs to improve on her 43% showing in New Hampshire.

foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/media-meltdown-why-journalism-battered-and-bleeding,"close Video Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy Responds To Attacks By The Media El Presidente! A conversation with the founder of Barstool Sports, Dave Portnoy. Let’s start with the good news. With a flick of a finger, more information is instantaneously available than at any time in human history. Stories, columns, opinions, video, photos, music, movies, texts, social media , streaming, podcasts. There are more ways to consume–desktop, phone, tablet, smartwatch–and infinitely more ways to voice your views. Okay, enough of that. The news business is in a tailspin. Firings and layoffs and buyouts are decimating its ranks. Publications and websites are folding. Revenue is plunging. Credibility is at an all-time low. And AI is starting to gobble up jobs. BIDEN’S LEAKED CAMPAIGN PLAN: TARGET TRUMP (OF COURSE) AND WORK SOCIAL MEDIA Worst of all, after the pandemic, scandals and impeachments , economic anxiety and political gridlock, interest in news is declining. In L.A. they’re always worried about the Big One. For media people it feels like the earthquake has already struck. The billionaire owner of the once-mighty Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, has fired the editor and more than 20 percent of its staff, devastating the Washington bureau and several key units. The billionaire owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos , has given buyouts to 240 staffers, decimating the metro staff and losing many of the paper’s biggest names. If newspapers aren’t owned by these wealthy moguls, they’re increasingly controlled by hedge funds whose strip-mining tactics have reduced them to a skeleton of their former selves. The Los Angeles Times has endorsed District Attorney George Gascón for re-election (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP/Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) From Vice to Vox , from Time (15 percent laid off) to Business Insider (8 percent), from Sports Illustrated (blown up) to BuzzFeed News (shuttered), the carnage is everywhere. And just yesterday, the Messenger, a news and aggregation site launched by Jimmy Finkelstein, former owner of the Hill, shut down after less than a year, having lost $38 million and some staffers lured from top publications. CNN just had a major round of layoffs. Cable news audiences are aging, and cord-cutting is growing in popularity. It’s not just that the voracious Internet broke the business model; that happened a quarter-century ago. It’s that there seems to be no end in sight. ""Journalists across the country burst into flames of panic this week, as bad news for the news business crested and erupted everywhere all at once,"" writes Jack Shafer in Politico. The impact is greatest on local reporting, with far fewer folks to check up on their city halls and statehouses , especially in smaller markets. THE MENTAL FITNESS MANIA: MEDIA NOW CHALLENGE BIDEN, TRUMP ""No matter how many heroic nonprofit newsrooms like the Baltimore Banner and Daily Memphian take root, no matter how many Substack-like newsletters blossom or creators emerge to drop their videos on YouTube, you can’t deny the journalism business’ decline,"" Shafer writes. What’s remarkable to me is how many of these pieces, and there have been many, overlook the importance of political bias. Republicans have been complaining about a liberal tilt since I began to read newspapers. Now, in the Trump era, half the country believes the media have become the opposition party, determined to block their man from returning to the White House. But during the Biden presidency, a growing percentage of those on the left have lost trust in the business as well. You have Red and Blue America, each filled with anger, each side viewing the other as evil and dangerous, with the press having forfeited its standing as a neutral arbiter of facts. ""What makes this so unnerving,"" says the Atlantic , ""is the fact that the meltdown has come amid—and in seeming defiance of—a generally booming economy. The ranks of professional journalists keep declining even as overall unemployment stays low, incomes rise, and the stock market reaches new heights."" ATLANTA, GEORGIA - NOVEMBER 17: A person walks past the headquarters of the Cable News Network (CNN) on November 17, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia. CNN's CEO and Chairman, Chris Licht, has confirmed that the company will begin layoffs in early December.  (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) The author, Paul Farhi, a longtime media reporter for the Washington Post, just took the paper’s buyout. ""What’s more, a presidential-election cycle tends to produce a surge of readers, viewers, and advertisers as people pay closer attention to the news. Not this time, at least so far."" Beyond news fatigue, Farhi notes, "" Facebook has steadily reduced the amount of news that users see in their feed, wiping out a major source of traffic."" I’d add that Google has gobbled some of that revenue as well. HOW NIKKI HALEY BURNED BRIDGES IN SOUTH CAROLINA–AND STILL PULLS PUNCHES AGAINST TRUMP There are obviously exceptions. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe are strong franchises. Fox News exceeds the prime-time ratings of CNN and MSNBC combined. But even television networks feel compelled to pour money into online shows and pay sites. ""Will journalism become a hobby like scrapbooking or street busking, done on the cheap or for donations, but one without much of a career path?"" Politico asks. (REUTERS/Serhii Nuzhnenko) I’m more pessimistic than I’ve ever been, and there’s no easy solution. Some say government subsidies are needed, but that raises serious conflict questions. And if zillionaires can’t revive newspapers and magazines, what hope is there for ordinary companies and local owners? I do think that just as television didn’t wipe out radio, journalism will have to morph into new and more compelling forms to survive. Who would have thought even three years ago that everyone and their brother-in-law would have a podcast?

Nikki Haley says she’s staying in the presidential race at least until Super Tuesday, though most of the media now deem the primary over and done with. While Donald Trump’s media detractors have found new lines of attack, they can’t deny that his big wins in Iowa and New Hampshire have practically given him a headlock on the nomination. But the biggest roadblock in her path is her own home state. AS TRUMP EASILY BEATS HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE VOWS TO STAY IN THE RACE How is it that a former two-term governor is trailing Trump by 20 to 30 points? The Trump juggernaut seems close to unstoppable. This Saturday’s Democratic primary in South Carolina (bold prediction: Joe Biden will win) will draw any potential party-switchers away from the GOP contest. And the Republican Party, transformed by Trump , is much more conservative in her state than when Haley left office in 2017. Even Haley, Trump’s former U.N. ambassador, isn’t predicting victory. She says she simply needs to do better than the 43 percent she won in New Hampshire’s open primary. That’s a tall order. Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the United Nations and 2024 Republican presidential candidate, during a campaign event in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg via Getty Images) But there’s an even deeper reality hurting Haley, according to some digging in South Carolina by two veteran New York Times reporters . All this came out during her years as governor, but is new to a national audience. There’s a reason, says the piece, that the governor, Henry McMaster, who had been her lieutenant governor, has endorsed Trump. And the House backbencher who she picked for senator, Tim Scott, has endorsed Trump. And the congresswoman whose career was threatened in 2022 until Haley endorsed her, Nancy Mace , has endorsed Trump. Haley said last week that South Carolina lawmakers had ""no love for me"" because she tried to make state government more transparent and vetoed pork-barrel projects. Longtime GOP consultant Chip Feikel told the paper ""she was good on economic development but not great on cultivating relationships. She forgot who helped her get here."" NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOWDOWN: WHY TRUMP IS CONNECTING WITH VOTERS AND HALEY AND DESANTIS HAVE NOT Perhaps the classic case involved former governor Mark Sanford, whose tenure was ruined by the ""Appalachian Trail"" extramarital affair, who agreed to her request for a $400,000 ad blitz to salvage her campaign. ""And then she cut me off,"" Sanford told Politico. ""This is systematic with Nikki: She cuts off people who have contributed to her success. It’s almost like there’s some weird psychological thing where she needs to pretend it’s self-made."" Ouch. There’s another way to look at this: ""Haley and her supporters attribute the hard feelings she left in her wake to jealousy, sexism and the sense that a young woman of color had simply not waited her turn."" Republican presidential hopeful and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks after results came in for the New Hampshire primaries during a watch party in Concord, New Hampshire, on January 23, 2024. (JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) But clearly, the accumulation of complaints reflects a pattern of burning bridges and alienating allies, even if it also depicts her as a fighter. While Haley has sharpened her rhetoric against the former president, regularly calling him ""unhinged,"" she is still pulling her punches. On Sunday’s ""Meet the Press,"" when host Kristen Welker asked whether the $83-million verdict in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case was ""disqualifying,"" Haley answered in process terms: ""I absolutely trust the jury. And I think that they made their decision based on the evidence. I just don't think that should take him off the ballot."" Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley speaks at a campaign town hall in Rye, New Hampshire, January 2, 2024. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder) On the third try, Welker asked: ""Why give him a pass on this issue, where a jury has found him liable for sexual abuse?"" ""I'm not giving him a pass on anything,"" Haley said before pivoting to Trump’s supposed decline as a 77-year-old. Everyone supports juries. What she did not do was address the substance of the accusations, which Trump continues to vehemently deny. Welker moved on: ""He has mocked your birth name. He has suggested you're not eligible to be president because your parents weren't born here. Of course, you are eligible. You were born here…What do you make of him bringing back this birther playbook against you? Do you think it will work in South Carolina and win over voters there?"" ""I mean, honestly, Kristen, I laugh every time I see one of his tweets, every time I see him throw a temper tantrum, because I know Donald Trump very well. When he feels insecure, he starts to rail. He starts to rant."" She completely ducked the question. Welker, again: ""Would you go so far as to call those attacks racist, Ambassador?"" ""I think that's for everybody else to decide."" Haley has obviously made a calculated decision not to criticize Trump too harshly on personal matters. She undoubtedly believes that could turn off MAGA voters who might defect to her. But with less than a month to go before her home state primary, the try-not-to-offend-anyone strategy isn’t working. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Footnote: Haley confirmed, as previously reported, that her house had been swatted–a false emergency call–while she was not at home. But she disclosed that she and her husband Michael, who’s away on military deployment, ""take care of my parents. They are 87 and 90…And they were at home and with their caregiver. And so I will tell you that the last thing you want is to see multiple law enforcement officials with guns drawn pointing at my parents and thinking that something happened. It is an awful situation. It put the law enforcement officers in danger. It put my family in danger."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This is outrageous and unacceptable.
