## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to develop topics models that help gain understanding into the different focuses between CNN and FoxNews articles. As both sources are politically focused, they make determinations on which topics to highlight over others. This information can be used by campaigns as they generally align with the political party thoughts on various topics.
